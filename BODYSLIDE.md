## female Faces

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard). There are no presets for Argonians and Khajiits for some reason. I made two male presets, a mage and a warrior, with an (M) after the name.

##  Female Bodies And Outfits

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. This Modlist offers two options for that. 

### "BodyGen4"

This is the standard option. It makes elves thin and orcs thick among other things. Every woman is a bit different. If you wish to use this option, download _BodyGen.Output.7z_ from [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/BS.for.LeS/releases/tag/0.1.G) and extract it to your _LeS Directory/mods/BodySlide Output/_ folder. When finished, it should contain a folder named _meshes_ with about a dozen other folders inside. These bodies and armors will look funky without BodyGen enabled. Your body will start plain and randomly change all the time unless you edit all your proportions by hand under _3BBB Morphs_. 

### "3BBB HangEmHigh"

If you want to use a non-random body based on how thin or thick the game designers meant people to be, download _3BBB.Output.7z_ from [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/BS.for.LeS/releases/tag/0.1.B) and **disable _BodyGen4_ in the left pane of MO2**. This process is much easier, just adjust "body size" in RaceMenu to change between thin and thick, instead of manually changing several dozen sliders.

### Running BodySlide

If you want to generate your own bodies, **first of all** you need to disable **_BodyGen4_** in the left pane or things will get _really_ weird. I have included a couple of _3BBB_ bodies and _many_ _CBBE_ ones, but you can always install your own.

You will also have to follow all of the steps below.

2. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Select your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Check the _Group Filter_ dropdown (the one with the tiny magnifying glass) to ensure that it is blank.
8. If it is not, click the small _X_ to clear it.
9.  In the top left dropdown, select one of the _CBBE_ options, such as _DCL - CBBE - Zipsuit_
10. Select your preset from the dropdown below that.
11. Preview it with the appropriate button.
12. Once you are satisfied, ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
13. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
14. You will see a huge list of bodies and armors. Just click _Build_.
15. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted armors. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
16. **Do not put your armors anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
17. For output set #1, choose _SE 3BBB Body Amazing_.
18. For all other options, choose _3BA_ if it is listed.
19. If it is not, choose _CBBE_.
20. This includes the _KS Collision Morphs._ **Absolutely do not choose BHUNP or TBD for these.**
21. Press **Build*.
22. Wait for your armors to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**. There should be close to 900 of them.
23. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
24. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from step 13.
25. When all outfits are successfully built, you may continue.

## A bit of a note on schlongs and strap-ons

Rather than use _SexLab_'s rather boring and badly-fitted strapon for scenes were a female is mistakenly placed in male role, an Oldrim mod called _Equippable Schlong_ has been included. To configure its appearance, follow these steps:

1. Open the inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open the inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. If you are running _Light But Kinky_ be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
11. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
12. Type in _TFC_.
13. Close the console with the same key.
14. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
15. Open the console again.
16. Type in _showracemenu_.
17. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
18. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
19. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
20. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).

If you are male, the above steps can also be used to customize your own schlong.

Unfortunately I've not matched the equippable schlong to the Demoniac skin yet. It looks pretty off. But it's still better than Calyps. I'm tired. Give me time.
