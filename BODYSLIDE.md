##  Female Bodies And Outfits

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. Here in the Skyrim community we use an application called _BodySlide_ for that.

**PLEASE NOTE: I have removed the option for BodyGen due to an abundance of confusion about how it works.**

### Running BodySlide

I have included a handful of 3BBB bodies, but you can always install your own.

You will also have to follow all of the steps below.

1. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Navigate to your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Click _Select Folder_
8. Click **OK**
9. Click the _Group Filter_ magnifying glass (upper right). 
10. Click _Choose Groups..._
11. Place a checkbox in the _3BBB_ option. Ensure that none others are selected. 
12. Click _OK_
13. In the top left dropdown, select _SE 3BBB Body Amazing_
14. Select your preset from the dropdown below that. 
15. Preview it with the appropriate button.
16. (I recommend the one called _3BBB HangEmHigh_ for natural beauty enthusiasts, or _3BBB Cacophony_ for fans of the dummy thicc.)
17. Once you are satisfied, ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
18. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
19. You will see a huge list of bodies and outfits. Just click _Build_.
20. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted outfits. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
21. **Do not put your outfits anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
22. Click _Select Folder_
23. Options for 4 helmets will appear. These helmets have a bit of hair sticking out. Decide what color you want them.
24. Click OK
25. Wait for your outfits to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**. There should be 939 of them.
26. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
27. Click OK
28. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from step 16 until you receive the above message.
29. When finished, navigate to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes** and make sure about a dozen outfits folders are there.
30. If there is only a _meshes_ folder there, move it to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**
31. **Confirm that all the outfits folders are in _LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes. They should not be located anywhere else.**
50. You may continue.

### Changing It Up

Sick of those dummy thicc boobs clapping against each other? Tired of being ridiculed as part of the itty-bitty-titty committee? If you get bored with the female body you have on everybody just come back to this portion of the readme and follow all the instructions with a different preset. Nothing will be harmed, your save won't be affected, it's just everybody will fit the new body. It's the 90's, a man's got to have a little variety.
