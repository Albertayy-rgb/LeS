##  Female Bodies And Outfits

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. This Modlist offers two options for that. 

### "BodyGen4"

The "Default" option is a series of procedurally generated body proportions for every person in the game based on their race. For example, elves will tend to be more petite, whereas orcs will tend to be more voluptuous. If you wish to use this option, download _BodyGen.Output.7z_ from [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/BS.for.LeS/) and extract it to your _LeS Directory/mods/BodySlide Output/_ folder. When finished, it should contain a folder named _meshes_ with about a dozen other folders inside. These bodies and armors will look funky without BodyGen enabled, so you will have to follow the steps below if you don't wish to use that feature. Also, please note that this means your body will be an incredibly dull default CBBE body until customized via _3BBB Morphs_ in RaceMenu. You will have to do this every time you start a new game. In addition, body morphs are not as responsive with _BodyGen_ enabled. If you don't see a change, give it a second or two. Finally, not all of the _3BBB Morphs_ do something, or at least that I can determine. You'll just have to deal with this.

### "3BBB HangEmHigh"

If you want to use a static body based around NPC weight values instead of RaceMenu morphs, download _3BBB.Output.7z_ from the link above and disable _BodyGen4_ in the left pane of MO2. One advantage to this is you get a supermodel style thin or thicc body just by sliding the weight slider around. Also, this body responds well to in-game live morphing features like boob growth from _Cursed Loot_ or belly growth from ... certain other things. Please enjoy this preset if you can, I worked hard on it, but I realize everyone has their own taste.

### Running BodySlide

If you want to generate your own bodies, **first of all** you need to disable **_BodyGen4_** in the left pane or things will get _really_ weird. I have included a couple of _3BBB_ bodies and _many_ _CBBE_ ones, but you can always install your own.

You will also have to follow all of the steps below.

2. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Select your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Check the _Group Filter_ dropdown (the one with the tiny magnifying glass) to ensure that it is blank.
8. If it is not, click the small _X_ to clear it.
9.  In the top left dropdown, select one of the _CBBE_ options, such as _DCL - CBBE - Zipsuit_
10. Select your preset from the dropdown below that.
11. Preview it with the appropriate button.
12. Once you are satisfied, ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
13. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
14. You will see a huge list of bodies and armors. Just click _Build_.
15. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted armors. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
16. **Do not put your armors anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
17. For output set #1, choose _SE 3BBB Body Amazing_.
18. For all other options, choose _3BA_ if it is listed.
19. If it is not, choose _CBBE_.
20. This includes the _KS Collision Morphs._ **Absolutely do not choose BHUNP or TBD for these.**
21. Press **Build*.
22. Wait for your armors to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**. There should be close to 900 of them.
23. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
24. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from step 13.
25. When all outfits are successfully built, you may continue.

## A bit of a note on schlongs and strap-ons

Rather than use _SexLab_'s rather boring and badly-fitted strapon for scenes were a female is mistakenly placed in male role, an Oldrim mod called _Equippable Schlong_ has been included. To configure its appearance, follow these steps:

1. Open the inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open the inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. If you are running _Light But Kinky_ be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
11. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
12. Type in _TFC_.
13. Close the console with the same key.
14. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
15. Open the console again.
16. Type in _showracemenu_.
17. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
18. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
19. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
20. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).

If you are male, the above steps can also be used to customize your own schlong.

Unfortunately I've not matched the equippable schlong to the Demoniac skin yet. It looks pretty off. But it's still better than Calyps. I'm tired. Give me time.
