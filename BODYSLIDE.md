## Female Faces

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard). There are no presets for Argonians and Khajiits for some reason. I made two male presets, a mage and a warrior, with an (M) after the name.

##  Female Bodies And Outfits

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. Here in the Skyrim community we use an application called _BodySlide_ for that.

**PLEASE NOTE: I have removed the option for BodyGen due to an abundance of confusion about how it works.**

### Running BodySlide

I have included a handful of 3BBB bodies, but you can always install your own.

You will also have to follow all of the steps below.

1. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Navigate to your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Click _Select Folder_
8. Click **OK**
9. Click the _Group Filter_ magnifying glass (upper right). 
10. Click _Choose Groups..._
11. Place a checkbox in the _3BBB_ option. Ensure that none others are selected. 
12. Click _OK_
13. In the top left dropdown, select _SE 3BBB Body Amazing_
14. Select your preset from the dropdown below that. 
15. Preview it with the appropriate button.
16. (I recommend the one called _3BBB HangEmHigh_ for natural beauty enthusiasts, or _3BBB Cacophony_ for fans of the dummy thicc.)
17. Once you are satisfied, ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
18. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
19. You will see a huge list of bodies and outfits. Just click _Build_.
20. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted outfits. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
21. **Do not put your outfits anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
22. Click _Select Folder_
23. Scroll down to "Output Set #15"
24. Choose "DDA - 3BA - RestrictiveCorsetBelt"
25. Scroll _all_ the way down to "Output Set #81"
26. Choose "DDX - 3BA - HarnessBoots01(HDT)"
27. Use your mouse wheel or the scroll bar to slowly page through the remaining outfits, selecting the "3BA" options when they are not defaulted as such.
28. If there is no 3BA option, just leave it as is.
29. Press **OK**.
30. Wait for your outfits to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**. There should be close to 882 of them.
31. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
32. Click OK
33. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from step 16 until you receive the above message.
34. When finished, navigate to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes** and make sure about a dozen outfits folders are there.
35. If there is only a _meshes_ folder there, move it to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**
36. **Confirm that all the outfits folders are in _LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes. They should not be located anywhere else.**
37. Next, Click the _Group Filter_ glass again.
38. Click _Choose Groups..._
39. Uncheck _3BBB_ and check _Unassigned_.
40. Click _OK_
41. Ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.
42. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
43. **Deselect all of the CBBE options. These will replace the CBBE 3BBB Bodies with the uncool CBBE Normie ones!**	
44. **Deselect all of the KS Hairs Options. These are incompatible with 3BBB and will cause your breasts to melt into the ground!**
45. Click _Build_
46. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted outfits. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
47. **Do not put your outfits anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
48. Press **Build**.
49. Wait for your armors to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**. There should be 15 of them.
50. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
51. Click _OK_
52. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from step 40 until you receive the above message.
53. When finished, navigate to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes** and make sure there is **NOT** a _meshes_ folder within.
54. If there is a _meshes_ folder there, move it to **_LeS Directory/mods/BodySlide Output_**
55. You may continue.
