##  Female Bodies And Armors

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. This Modlist offers two options for that. 

### "BodyGen4"

The "Default" option is a series of procedurally generated body proportions for every person in the game based on their race. For example, elves will tend to be more petite, whereas orcs will tend to be more voluptuous. If you wish to use this option, download _BodySlide.Output.7z_ from <a href="https://github.com/cacophony-wj/BS.for.LeS/">here</a> and extract it to your _LeS Directory/mods/BodySlide Output/_ folder. When finished, it should contain a folder named _meshes_ with about a dozen other folders inside. These bodies and armors will look funky without BodyGen enabled, so you will have to follow the steps below if you don't wish to use that feature. Also, please note that this means your body will be an incredibly dull default CBBE body until customized via _3BBB Morphs_ in RaceMenu. You will have to do this every time you start a new game. In addition, body morphs are not as responsive with _BodyGen_ enabled. If you don't see a change, give it a second or two. Finally, not all of the _3BBB Morphs_ do something, or at least that I can determine. You'll just have to deal with this.

### Running BodySlide

If you want to generate your own bodies, **first of all** you need to disable **_BodyGen4_** in the left pane or things will get _really_ weird.

you will also have to follow all of the steps below.

1. **MAKE CERTAIN YOU ARE ON LIGHT BUT KINKY.** Doing so with ensure that all armors for both profiles will be built in one go.
2. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Select your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Ensure that the _Preset_ is set to "3BBB HangEmHigh." If you wish to use a different one, select it from the menu or install your own.
8. Check the _Group Filter_ dropdown to ensure that it reads _3BBB_. (It's just to the left of the _Outfit Filter_ in the upper-right corner.) 
9.  If that dropdown is blank, or something else is listed there, click the small **magnifying glass** within the _Groups Filter_ dropdown.
10. Place a check in the box beside _3BBB_ (the top option).
11. Click **OK**.
12. Ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
13. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
14. You will see a huge list of bodies and armors. Just click _Build_.
15. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted armors. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
16. **Do not put your armors anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
17. I have combined the options greatly so nobody has to waste a lot of time in here. The only thing you need to choose is the color of hair poking out of a few helmets. If you are female, it is probably best to put your own hair color here. If you are male, it doesn't matter, but any female you encounter with one of these helmets will have the hair color you chose here.
18. Once you have all four helmets chosen, press **OK**.
19. Wait for all the outfits to be built.
20. If you have _no interest_ in the _Light But Kinky_ variant, you are now finished. Skip to the last step.
21. Click the magnifying glass next to _3BBB_.
22. Uncheck _3BBB_ at the top and check _Unassigned_ at the bottom.
23. Ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
24. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
25. Right-click anywhere in the small window and choose _Select None_.
26. Scroll through the list until you find "BreastRopeExtreme01."
27. Select five entries.
28. The last one selected should be "BreastRopeWithWaistRopeExtreme02."
29. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the small window.
30. Starting at the bottom and moving up, sekect the eight entries from "ZAZGSBDoggieBelt" to "Shibari."
31. Press _Build_.
32. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted breast ropes. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
33. **Do not put your ropes anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
34. The ropes should build so fast you'll hardly notice.
35. If at any point you received a message that an outfit failed to build, write down the outfit that failed, select it from the dropdown, and click the big _Build_ button in the bottom-center. Repeat for any other failed outfits until you get no errors.
36. You should now be ready to launch Skyrim with the **_RUN ME_** dropdown. Make certain to switch back to _Light But Sexy_ if that is the list you wish to play.

## A bit of a note on schlongs and strap-ons

Rather than use _SexLab_'s rather boring and badly-fitted strapon for scenes were a female is mistakenly placed in male role, an Oldrim mod called _Equippable Schlong_ has been included. To configure its appearance, follow these steps:

1. Open the inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open the inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. If you are running _Light But Kinky_ be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
11. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
12. Type in _TFC_.
13. Close the console with the same key.
14. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
15. Open the console again.
16. Type in _showracemenu_.
17. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
18. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
19. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
20. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).

If you are male, the above steps can also be used to customize your own schlong.
