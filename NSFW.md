### SexLab - Frameworks

[SexLab Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/91861-sexlab-framework-se-163-beta-8-november-22nd-2019/) is the core of all installed LL mods. Do note that this is a **beta build**. [SLAL](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5328-sexlab-animation-loader-sse/) or _SexLab Animation Loader_ and [SexLab Aroused Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5482-sexlab-aroused-redux-sse-version-29/) are included as well.

The _Light but Kinky_ variant includes [Creature Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5462-creature-framework-se/) and [More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/4130-more-nasty-critters-slal-edition/).

[ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) is a requirement for other mods so you get that and the [ZAZ 8.0+ CBBE HDT Rev3](https://mega.nz/#!WEgGDaCa!wAho2Rphy47Lcd55DEmV50GgN07CMnTjhQ_r9s6dq-I) version.

### Devious Devices

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/99700-devious-devices-se-43/) or DD for short is a very interesting mod and the foundation for [Devious Skyrim](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/30855-devious-skyrim/) (you should definitely read that post if you are into BDSM content). The conversion to SSE is a bit... funky to say the least but they finally build the SKSE plugin for 2.0.17. The conversion contains all three base mods: [Assets](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/269-devious-devices-assets/), [Expansion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1305-devious-devices-expansion/) and [Integration](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/371-devious-devices-integration/).

The outfit conversions in the base DD AIO are incompatible with the body type I use so [3BA Bodyslides for Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11938-3ba-bodyslides-for-devious-devices-43-aio/) is included to help with that.

DD alone does not do much as a framework. The biggest gameplay mod for DD is DCUR aka [Deviously Cursed Loot](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/33986-deviously-cursed-loot-v85-2020-03-24/). This mod is *huge*. Takes like 20mins to do the MCM and you should, no, you _must_ read up on it _thoroughly_ if you want to customize it. I have tried my best at configuring this mod in a way that makes sense and enables you to actually play the game without being tied up, locked up or assaulted every 5 meters. The main premise of this mods still stands:

> Cursed Loot is a bondage and domination (BD) themed mod that will get you into trouble of the erotic kind when playing Skyrim. Beware when looting containers and defeated enemies in Skyrim!

There are dangers in Skyrim, mainly in Dungeons, that will keep you on guard and are more of an exception than a rule to make them more impactful. I will try tweaking the config more over time so be sure to voice your opinion (see [Contact](#contact)).

[Devious Devices Helpers](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9197-devious-devices-helpers-se/) counteracts all the restraints and makes your followers smarter when it comes to dealing with them.

> While playing with Deviously Cursed Loot and other Devious Devices mods, I found that my character being tied up and helpless was amusing for about five minutes.

This is what I am going for: have fun for some time but then get back to playing the game. The combination of Cursed Loot and Helpers should hopefully provide that gameplay experience. The entire thing is still experimental so expect tweaks to come over time.

Some big DD mods like [Sanguines Debauchery](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/120107-skyrimlldeepbluefrog-mods-conversion-to-sse/#comments) are not yet ready for SSE.

### SexLab - Others

The following mods have a more _supportive_ role and do not fit any of the other categories.

[SexLab Aroused Monitor Widget](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11466-sexlab-aroused-monitor-widget-se/) adds a little widget that displays the arousal levels of nearby actors.

[SexLab Tools](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2018-sexlab-tools-v30/) gives you tools to control a scene.

[Sexlab LightMeUp](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8275-sexlab-lightmeup/) will illuminate the current SexLab scene so you don't have to pull out any additional torches and can actually see whats happening.

###  Defeat

Defeat is ... a little buggy, to say the least... but I have included it in _Light But Sexy_ as a potential death alternative. I have most of it disabled because it breaks too often and forces a reload. About the only thing left active in my setup is the ability to "surrender" with the _K_ key. Surrender as soon as you're outnumbered if you want a scene because the script delay can be excessive. If you want to enable more of this mod's features feel free, but be prepared for situations such as being stuck to the ground, unable to move, stuck to the ground _and_ unable to move, or unable to interact with anything or open your inventory. I will not help you resolve Defeat's issues.

### Nomkaz

You may have seen his name pop up a few hundred times when browsing the [Skyrim: Special Edition](https://www.loverslab.com/files/category/163-skyrim-special-edition/) category on LoversLab. This dude converted everything. Check his profile and leave a nice comment for all his work!

## SFW Mods

I'm just going to touch on these since most of them are in other lists (particularly Lexy's), so many people will already be familiar with them.

### Dragons

The familiar combo of _Deadly Dragons + Diverse Dragons + Dragon Variants_ is in here, with all that entails. It's rather difficult if you're used to the boring dragons from vanilla Skyrim because now they shoot fireballs and rain them from the sky among loads of other things, so if you're new to this setup get ready.

### Animals

I have included [Animallica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20456) for greater variety in taxidermy targets because the same old wolves get boring fast and Immersive Creatures has crashing issues on a lot of setups. There's a bit of an incompatibility with MNC if you're on Kinky but I think the added variety is worth it as I rarely play with that mod. 

### Followers

I use [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076) to allow for up to 100 followers or summoned NPC's (but realistically you'll have to keep it to six or fewer). Most of the options are self-explanatory but if you want then to join you at your level and gain them when you do, you can open the console, click on them, and enter the command "bat nfflevel"

### Transformations

My chosen vampire mod is Enai's [Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928) because it's the most compatible, but for werewolves I use the old standby [Moonlight Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35470). Both are a bit overpowered in this setup but you can tweak the MCMs if you find things getting too easy.
