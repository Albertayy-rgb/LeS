### SexLab - Frameworks

[SexLab Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/91861-sexlab-framework-se-163-beta-8-november-22nd-2019/) is the core of all installed LL mods. Do note that this is a **beta build** and as such you should probably refer to the section in the main document entitled [A Bit of a Note on SexLab for the Unintiated] as well as the entire [Troubleshooting] section. [SLAL](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5328-sexlab-animation-loader-sse/) or _SexLab Animation Loader_ and [SexLab Aroused Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5482-sexlab-aroused-redux-sse-version-29/) are included as well.

The _Light But Sexy_ variant includes [M2M Animations](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2625-m2m-gay-animations/) for man-to-man options which are entirely optional and disabled by default. 

The _Light but Kinky_ variant includes [Creature Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5462-creature-framework-se/), [More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/4130-more-nasty-critters-slal-edition/), and [BakaFactory's ABC](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7556-animated-beasts-cocksabc-for-users-le-se/). Don't click those!

[ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) is a requirement for other mods so you get that and the [ZAZ 8.0+ CBBE HDT Rev3](https://mega.nz/#!WEgGDaCa!wAho2Rphy47Lcd55DEmV50GgN07CMnTjhQ_r9s6dq-I) version.

### Specific to Light But Sexy

####  Defeat

[SexLab Defeat SSE](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/122306-sexlab-defeat-sse/) is ... a little buggy, to say the least... but I have included it in _Light But Sexy_ as a potential death alternative. I have most of it disabled because it breaks too often and forces a reload. About the only thing left active in my setup is the ability to "surrender" with the _K_ key. Surrender as soon as you're outnumbered if you want a scene because the script delay can be excessive. If you want to enable more of this mod's features feel free, but be prepared for an intolerably number of bugs. I spent enough time trying to understand them, much less fix them. I will not help you resolve _Defeat_'s issues. Do note that I also include [BakaFactory's Defeat Patch](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sexlab-defeat-1-32912602) to improve the scripting and animations.

### Specific to Light but Kinky

### Devious Devices

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/99700-devious-devices-se-43/) is a comprehensive _BDSM_ mod and the foundation for [Devious Skyrim](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/30855-devious-skyrim/). The conversion to SSE is a bit... funky to say the least but they finally build the SKSE plugin for 2.0.17. The conversion contains all three base mods: [Assets](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/269-devious-devices-assets/), [Expansion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1305-devious-devices-expansion/) and [Integration](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/371-devious-devices-integration/). I have automatically reduced most of the punishing aspects such as _extremely slow walking_ (a big offender), blindness, and item dropping so this mod is at least halfway enjoyable.

The outfit conversions in the base DD AIO are incompatible with the body type I use so [3BA Bodyslides for Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11938-3ba-bodyslides-for-devious-devices-43-aio/) is included to help with that.

_Devious Devices_ alone does not do much as a framework. The biggest and most popular gameplay mod for _Devious Devices_ is [Deviously Cursed Loot](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/33986-deviously-cursed-loot-v85-2020-03-24/). This mod is *huge*. Takes like 20mins to do the MCM and you should read up on it sometime. I have tried my best at configuring this mod in a way that makes sense and enables you to actually play the game without being tied up, locked up or assaulted every 5 meters. This configuration is **open to suggestions** so if something happens to you that's intolerable please let me know on Github.

[Devious Devices Helpers](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9197-devious-devices-helpers-se/) counteracts all the restraints and makes your followers smarter when it comes to dealing with them. Basically they can unlock any of your devices for you with a 100% success rate if you leave them all your keys. They also will never drop those keys. The _Devious_ content is also given a voluntary option as your _Helpers_ will tie you with random gear on request or occasionally prompt for it if they are horny. Don't worry, they won't tie you with anything they don't have a key for.

### SexLab - Others

The following mods have a more _supportive_ role and do not fit any of the other categories.

[SexLab Tools](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2018-sexlab-tools-v30/) gives you tools to control a scene.

[Sexlab LightMeUp](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8275-sexlab-lightmeup/) will illuminate the current SexLab scene so you don't have to pull out any additional torches and can actually see whats happening.

### Nomkaz

You may have seen his name pop up a few hundred times when browsing the [Skyrim: Special Edition](https://www.loverslab.com/files/category/163-skyrim-special-edition/) category on LoversLab. This dude converted everything. Check his profile and leave a nice comment for all his work!
