## Licentia et Servitium Configuration

## A bit of a note on System Settings

I turned the music off. See below. You will also need to set your QuickSave and QuickLoad hotkeys, as Wabbajack does not change them.

### Audio

I have heard Jeremy Soule's default _Skyrim_ tracks so much that I am tired of them. I listen to something else. The music is at zero. If you want it, turn it up.

## Controls

These are all to your liking, except for _Quicksave_ which should be set to _F9_, and _Quickload_ which should be set to _F10_. Don't worry about using them becuase _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves.

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have both ceased appearing and disappearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing.

### SexLab

#### Install

Under **SexLab 1.63 SE dev beta 8 by Ashal@LoversLab.com**

Click _INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8_

Close the menu and wait. Once again, a series of messages will appear in the upper left corner. 

Do not touch the mouse or keyboard until the following message appears:

**SexLab - SexLab v1.63 SE dev beta 8 - Ready!**

Then open the MCM and continue.

### SexLab

####  Rebuild & Clean

Just below **Debug / Development Mode** in the upper right corner, click _Import Settings: Click Here_

A message will appear which concludes with "Do you want to continue?" Click _Accept_

Another message will appear, "SexLab configuration successfully imported." Click _Accept_

Finally, under **Available Strap-ons** near the lower left you will see _Calyps Strapon REMOVE_. Click this option and wait for it to disappear from the list of strap-ons.

#### Animation Settings

If you have a furry side, click _Allow creature animation_ in the upper right. This is **not** limited to werewolves and vampires so be **sure** you want to get **freaky** before you enable it. If you do so, close the MCM and wait until a message stating **SexLab Creature Animations Installed** appears **twice**.

Finally, _SexLab_ is configured so that nude, opposite-sex characters cause you to become aroused by default. If you wish to change this, reopen the MCM and navigate to

### SexLab

#### Sex Diary / Journal

Under **Sexual stats** on the right, click _Sexuality_ until your preference (Bisexual, Gay, or Lesbian) appears.

### SAVE AND LOAD!

Lover's Lab recommends saving and loading the game immediately after fully configuring SexLab. Please do so now. If the QuickSave and QuickLoad buttons have changed, recall that they are now _F9_ and _F10_.

###  ZaZ Animation Pack

**If you are a male character, or have no interest in _Devious Devices_ or BDSM content, ignore this menu.**

####  SexLab

When first clicking this menu, it may appear to be stuck. It takes about a minute to show any visible change. Just wait. 

**SexLab Animations**: Click the grayed out word _Register_ and wait 30 - 60 seconds until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. 

Under **Animation**, uncheck _Override_ as Devious already handles this function.

###  SL Anim Loader

####  General Options

Click _Enable All: Click Here_

Click _Rebuild SexLab Anim Registry_. (For those familiar with _SexLab_, this is necessary due to some of the non-_SLAL_ animations I included.)

Open the console with the _Tilde_ key (~) and wait for all messages to stop. It can take a _very_ long time. 

You will see a popup that reads "Animation registry has been successfully reset" but ignore it. You need to wait until all of the animations find their slots.

### AGO

#### Enable/Disable

Uncheck _Persistent Arrows_

### Cathedral Weathers

Click _Load Settings_

###  CGO

#### Settings

I have configured everything but the leaning for you. Changing from one-handed to two-handed is done with the _Left Shift_ key. Dual-Wield Blocking is done with the _Scroll Wheel Button_ (or _MOUSE 3_). Dodge roll is set to _CTRL_ when moving. When standing still, you will crouch or uncrouch.

_Leaning_

I prefer the _procedural leaning_ and _camera movement_ at X1.00, but it disagrees with many players' stomachs.

If you find uncomfortable nausea happening to you, I recommend the following values:

_Lean Multiplier (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

_Lean Multiplier (3rd Person)_: _X1.00_

_Camera Noise_

_Camera Noise Mult (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

You may also find that the first-person roll animation causes you to feel uneasy. I recommend dropping to third person for melee in that case.

### Cursed Loot

**If you are a male character, or have no interest in BDSM and submissive roleplay do the following**

Navigate to

#### Debug

And click _Shut down all functions_, then wait until it is unchecked.

Otherwise, click _Import Settings - USE_ and upon receiving the message **Are you sure?** click _Accept_

### Devious Devices Helpers

**If you are a male character, or have no interest in BDSM content do the following**

#### Feature Enables

Uncheck _Follower asks to tie player_

You will still have bondage related dialogs in conversations with followers. Can't be helped, so don't select them.

###  Follower Framework

Please do this. Horses may be involved if you don't.

###  SexLab Eager NPCs

####  General

Click _Enable and load profile - (CLICK)_. 

Upon receiving the message **Profile loaded successfully!** click _OK_ and close the MCM.

You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. 

Wait for two messages to appear in the upper left: **Mounted Exposure (SLEN) added** and **Masturbate (SLEN) added**.

###  SexLab Solutions

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

### SexLab Tools

#### Settings

_Matchmaker queue_

**Matchmaker queue key**: set to _NUMPAD 2_

Ignore the message that the key is already mapped and answer "Yes."

**Please Note**: You can hover your crosshair over any actor and press _NUMPAD 2_ to set up a sex scene. Please note that the _first_ slot is always the _receiver_ in a sex scene. Every other slot is an _actor._. To add yourself to a slot, hover your crosshair over a nonliving object and press _NUMPAD 2_. Then select a slot. To begin the scene instead, select _Begin scene_. While a scene is running, you can press the _H_ key to select from a list of available animations.

### Spank That Ass

**Very important: This mod was made by a unique person who likes female spanking.**

**If you are a male character or don't like a healthy spanking now and again, you will want to uncheck the following**

#### Spanking

_Allow Sex Spanks_

_Allow Bump Spanks_

#### Player Dialogue

Set _Player Dialogue Level_ to _OFF_

**If you are female and want to get spanked**

Scroll down until you see

Press _OK_

### XPMSE

Check _Disable Style Cloak Spell_

###  Defeat

**Please note, if involuntary sex is not a roleplaying kink of yours, do not enable this mod**

**It is recommended to only enable this if you disabled _Cursed Loot_. If you insist on trying it, please return to the _Cursed Loot_ MCM and disable _Combat Surrender._**

Please ensure that you have configured every other MCM before this one.

Then save and load your game.

This is in case you need to change settings upon a restart, because Defeat must always be configured _last_.

####  General Settings

Click _Mod Status - DISABLED_

Upon receiving the message **Installing... you must close the menu and wait until you see the notification.** click _Accept_

Close the MCM and wait for the message **Defeat: Installed**. 

Re-open.

Next, click _Import Settings_ on the right.

**_INVALID ASSAULTS WILL DO NOTHING AND LEAVE YOU A MOMENT TO RECOVER YOUR COMPOSURE AND TRY AGAIN_**

**_ON THE UPSIDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SKYRIM LOAD ON DEATH PROBLEM_**

If you want to enable or disable things such as men, women, flying purple people eaters, do so in the "player as victim" section.

## All done! I wash my hands of you now!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen, it helps if you give it a minute before trying). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. If you don't like the lusty starting options I made for you, come to #licentia-et-servitium support on Wabbajack's Discord and say the safe word "Svirfneblin" and I will tell you how to get them all back. Please note: many of them are disabled for good reasons. Don't worry, as long as you have the save from before you talked to the statue, you will not have to do the MCMs over again.
