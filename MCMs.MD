## Licentia et Servitium Configuration

## A bit of a note on System Settings

I have had users experience incidents where my Skyrim default settings were not being installed upon the completion of _Wabbajack._ Before continuing, ensure that under the _System Menu_ (ESC) the following options are chosen.

## Settings 

### Gameplay

Everything here should be **UNCHECKED** except for _Show Floating Markers_. Difficulty is recommended at _Expert_, but is ultimately up to you.

### Display

_Depth of Field_ should be all the way to the left.

## Controls

These are all to your liking, except for _Quicksave_ which should be set to _F9_, and _Quickload_ which should be set to _F10_. Don't worry about using them becuase _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves.

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have both ceased appearing and disappearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing.

### SexLab

#### Install

Under **SexLab 1.63 SE dev beta 8 by Ashal@LoversLab.com**

Click _INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8_

Close the menu and wait. Once again, a series of messages will appear in the upper left corner. 

Do not touch the mouse or keyboard until the following message appears:

**SexLab - SexLab v1.63 SE dev beta 8 - Ready!**

Then open the MCM and continue.

####  Rebuild & Clean

Just below **Debug / Development Mode** in the upper right corner, click _Import Settings: Click Here_

A message will appear which concludes with "Do you want to continue?" Click _Accept_

Another message will appear, "SexLab configuration successfully imported." Click _Accept_

Finally, under **Available Strap-ons** near the lower left you will see _Calyps Strapon REMOVE_. Click this option and wait for it to disappear from the list of strap-ons.

If _Light But Kinky_ is the active profile, navigate to

#### Animation Settings

And click _Allow creature animation_ in the upper right. Close the MCM and wait until a message stating **SexLab Creature Animations Installed** appears **twice**.

Creature animations **will not work** for the _Light But Sexy_ profile. Do not attempt it.

Finally, _SexLab_ is configured so that opposite-sex characters cause you to become aroused by default. If you wish to change this, reopen the MCM and navigate to

#### Sex Diary / Journal

Under **Sexual stats** on the right, click _Sexuality_ until your preference (Bisexual, Homosexual or Lesbian) appears.

### SAVE AND LOAD!

Lover's Lab recommends saving and loading the game immediately after fully configuring SexLab. Please do so now. If the QuickSave and QuickLoad buttons have changed, recall that they are now _F9_ and _F10_.

###  ZaZ Animation Pack

**Only available with _Light But Kinky_.**

####  SexLab

When first clicking this menu, it may appear to be stuck. It takes about a minute to show any visible change. Just wait. 

**SexLab Animations**: Click the grayed out word _Register_ and wait 30 - 60 seconds until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. 

Under **Animation**, uncheck _Override_ as Devious already handles this function.

### M2M Animations

#### Only available with _Light But Sexy_

I have included gay animations for those interested. SLEN prefers them for its gay scenes, and many of them are higher quality than most straight animations. If this content offends you, do not click this menu. For those who wish it, select

#### Config M2M

_M2M Version 9.00 for SexLab 1.62_

_Register SexLab Anims_

And wait for the message "SexLab's Animation Registry has been updated."

Click _Accept_

###  SL Anim Loader

####  General Options

Click _Enable All: Click Here_

Click _Register Animations: Click Here_

Wait for the **Registered _X_ new animations** message (the number varies for each profile). Be patient, it can take up to five minutes.

###  CGO

#### Settings

_Unlocked Grip_

Click on _ESC_ next to _Hotkey_ and press the _Shift_ key.

_Dual Wield Blocking_

Click on _ESC_ next to _Hotkey_ and click down on your mouse wheel (should say _M3_ after this)

_Leaning_

I prefer the _procedural leaning_ and _camera movement_ at X1.00, but it disagrees with many players' stomachs.

To ensure this doesn't happen for any other users, I recommend the following values:

_Lean Multiplier (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

_Lean Multiplier (3rd Person)_: _X1.00_

_Camera Noise_

_Camera Noise Mult (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

You may also find that the first-person roll animation causes you to feel uneasy. I recommend dropping to third person for melee in that case.

### Cursed Loot

**Only available with _Light But Kinky_.**

#### Debug

Click _Import Settings - USE_ and upon viewing the message asking **Are you sure?** click _Accept_

###  Follower Framework

####  System

In the upper right, click _Load From File - CLICK HERE_

At the message **Settings Loaded. Please exist the MCM menu to apply all changes.** click _Ok_

Exit the MCM and re-open it.

Familiarize yourself with the keys under this menu's header labeled **Hotkeyed Abilities**.

### LOTD Settings

This is primarily intended for moments in _Light But Kinky_ when you can't Fast Travel.

#### General

_Shipment Crate Locations_

Enable _Carriages_

Enable _Inns_

Enable _Player Homes_

###  Quick Light

_Brightness: Wide_

_Light Key: NUMPAD 1_

Uncheck _Enable to Long press activation key_

###  SexLab Aroused

#### Settings

_General_

Check _Enable SOS_.

#### Puppet Master

Here is where you can put a check next to _Exhibitionism_ if you want your arousal to rise when you are naked.

###  SexLab Eager NPCs

**Only available with _Light But Sexy_.**

####  General

Click _Enable and load profile - (CLICK)_. 

Upon receiving the message **Profile loaded successfully!** click _OK_ and close the MCM.

You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. 

Wait for two messages to appear in the upper left: **Mounted Exposure (SLEN) added** and **Masturbate (SLEN) added**.

###  SexLab Solutions

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

You should only select the next option if you use _Light But Sexy_.

For _Light But Kinky_ users, the option will be grayed out.

####  Miscellaneous

_Integration_

Click _SLEN integration_

### SexLab Tools

#### Settings

_Matchmaker queue_

**Matchmaker queue key**: set to _NUMPAD 2_

Ignore the message that the key is already mapped and answer "Yes."

**Please Note**: You can hover your crosshair over any actor and press _NUMPAD 2_ to set up a sex scene. Please note that the _first_ slot is always the _receiver_ in a sex scene. Every other slot is an _actor._. To add yourself to a slot, hover your crosshair over a nonliving object and press _NUMPAD 2_. Then select a slot. To begin the scene instead, select _Begin scene_. While a scene is running, you can press the _H_ key to select from a list of available animations.

###  Sky UI

**Font Size**: _Small_

_Active Effects HUD_

**Icon Size**: _Small_

Set the first four **Favorite Groups** to _F5 - F8_ to avoid a conflict with follower commands.

Wait a moment. You will see some stuff cycling. Then the message

_"VioLens.VLMS" Loaded_

Press _OK_

### XPMSE

Check _Disable Style Cloak Spell_

###  Defeat

**Only available with _Light But Sexy_.**

Please ensure that you have configured every other MCM before this one.

Then save and load your game.

This is in case you need to change settings upon a restart, because Defeat must always be configured _last_.

####  General Settings

Click _Mod Status - DISABLED_

Upon receiving the message **Installing... you must close the menu and wait until you see the notification.** click _Accept_

Close the MCM and wait for the message **Defeat: Installed**. 

Re-open.

Next, click _Import Settings_ on the right.

## All done!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen, it helps if you give it a minute before trying). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. If you are on _Light But Sexy_, I recommend one of the _Something Sexy_ starts (dropped nude into a sticky situation) and if you are on _Light But Kinky_, I recommend the _Sex Slave_ start for a good look into how _Cursed Loot_ works. Spoiler though, there is no sex, just lots of bouncy walking in bondage gear.
