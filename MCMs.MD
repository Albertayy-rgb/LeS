## Licentia et Servitium Configuration

## Click New Game

You might wonder why I put something so obvious here but you'd be surprised at the questions I get. It takes longer to load Skyrim with all these textures, and if you're not on an SSD you're probably going to have a bad time.

## Character Creation

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard). There are no presets for Argonians and Khajiits for some reason. I made two male presets, a mage and a warrior, with an (M) after the name. Tweak to your liking, you might enjoy some of the _KS SMP_ hairs in the rightward section of the _Hairs_ slider, they have physics which probably won't work until character creation is complete. You can also tweak your body a bit with the _3BBB_ Morphs_ and _Genitals_ options, but I am not going to go into that. Don't ask me either. Experiment and figure it out. One thing you can do is open the console with the _Tilde `_ key, click on yourself, and type _unequipall_, and then reload your preset to go nude. Click _Done_ (in the lower left) when you are finished.

## AS SOON AS CHARACTER CREATION IS COMPLETE

You will get a **POPUP** about "Relic Notifications". Answer ok and **DO NOTHING** until the second popup appears. When it does, tell it that you **DO NOT** wish to scan the museum. After a third popup, you should be ready to continue.

## A bit of a note on System Settings

Sometimes I forget to turn the music up. See below. You will also need to set your QuickSave and QuickLoad hotkeys, as Wabbajack does not change them.

### Audio

I have heard Jeremy Soule's default _Skyrim_ tracks so much that I am tired of them. I listen to something else a lot of the time. The music may be set to zero.

### Controls

These are all to your liking, except for _Quicksave_ which should be set to _F9_, and _Quickload_ which should be set to _F10_. Don't worry about using them because _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves.

I'm oldschool so sometimes I play with an inverted controller. If your controls are inverted you might have to change it since I forgot to.

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have both ceased appearing and disappearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing.

### SexLab

#### Install

Under **SexLab 1.63 SE dev beta 8 by Ashal@LoversLab.com**

Click _INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8_

Close the menu and wait. Once again, a series of messages will appear in the upper left corner. 

Do not touch the mouse or keyboard until the following message appears:

**SexLab - SexLab v1.63 SE dev beta 8 - Ready!**

Then open the MCM and continue.

### SexLab

####  Rebuild & Clean

Just below **Debug / Development Mode** in the upper right corner, click _Import Settings: Click Here_

A message will appear which concludes with "Do you want to continue?" Click _Accept_

Another message will appear, "SexLab configuration successfully imported." Click _Accept_

Finally, you will notice three options under **Available Strap-ons**. A word here, if you don't mind.

Women get put into a male role sometimes with SexLab. I don't know how to fix it. 

A method was recommended to me but it didn't work. So sometimes they will strap it on. You basically have three options.

_Calyps Strapon_ - A strapon. This is ugly and won't fit the female body.

_CBBE Futanari_ - Works just like a penis. Texture looks okay with a bit of a seam. Has balls.

_Equipable Schlong_ - Works just like a penis. Texture doesn't match the body at all. Doesn't have balls.

Whichever of these you leave active will be used randomly when a woman takes a male role. To disable one, just click _REMOVE_ until it disappears. To restore them, click _REBUILD_.

Choose wisely.

Technically there is a fourth option:

_Invisidick_ - The animation plays but with nothing attached to the woman. You can switch positions for her with _Shift+H_.

To get this, uncheck _Women Wear Strapons_ in **Animation Settings**.

Note that **ALL** of _SexLab's_ original old animations have been suppressed due to unpopularity. If you want to re-enable them for some reason, click _CLEAR SUPPRESSED LIST - CLICK HERE_

#### Animation Settings

_**Creature animations are disabled by default**._ To prevent this, click _Allow creature animation_ in the upper right and make sure it's disabled. These are **not** limited to werewolves and vampires so be **sure** you want to get **freaky** before you allow it to remain enabled.

Finally, _SexLab_ is configured so that nude, opposite-sex characters cause you to become aroused by default. If you wish to change this, reopen the MCM and navigate to

### SexLab

#### Sex Diary / Journal

Under **Sexual stats** on the right, click _Sexuality_ until your preference (Bisexual, Gay, or Lesbian) appears.

### SAVE AND LOAD!

Lover's Lab recommends saving and loading the game immediately after fully configuring SexLab. Please do so now. If the QuickSave and QuickLoad buttons have changed, recall that they are now _F9_ and _F10_.

###  ZaZ Animation Pack

**If you disabled Cursed Loot, ignore this menu.**

####  SexLab

When first clicking this menu, it may appear to be stuck. It takes about a minute to show any visible change. Just wait. 

**SexLab Animations**: Click the _Register_ and wait 30 - 60 seconds until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. 

Under **Animation**, uncheck _Override_ as Devious already handles this function.

###  SL Anim Loader

#### General Options

Click _Enable All: Click Here_

The process will take about five minutes, whereupon you will receive a message that around 580 animations have been registered. Just click _Accept_

###  CGO

#### Settings

I have configured everything but the leaning and first person camera bobbing for you. Changing from one-handed to two-handed is done with the _Left Shift_ key. Dual-Wield Blocking is done with the _Scroll Wheel Button_ (or _MOUSE 3_). Dodge roll is set to _CTRL_ when moving. When standing still, you will crouch or uncrouch.

_Leaning_

I prefer the _procedural leaning_ and _camera movement_ (also known as **bobbing**) at X1.00, but it does cause rather severe motion sickness in some players.

**If you find uncomfortable nausea happening to you, I recommend the following values:**

_Lean Multiplier (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

_Lean Multiplier (3rd Person)_: _X1.00_

_Camera Noise_

_Camera Noise Mult (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

**You may also find that the first-person roll animation causes you to feel motion sick.**

Either disable it and set it to _Hotkey_ (with _ESC_ as the value) or switch to third person if you want to roll.

### Cursed Loot

**If you disabled Cursed Loot this menu won't be here**

#### Debug

**If you are a female character and wish to fight bondage gear almost as much as you do bandits do the following**

Click _Import Settings_ and upon receiving the message **Are you sure?** click _Accept_

**Last warning, if you are male and have not disabled Cursed Loot you will randomly go invisible.**

**If you have not read the entire landing page (README.md) go back and examine the section about "Combat Surrender" before continuing.**

###  Follower Framework

####  System

In the upper right, click _Load From File - CLICK HERE_

At the message **Settings Loaded. Please exist the MCM menu to apply all changes.** click _Ok_

Exit the MCM and re-open it.

A bit of a note here. I did not alter Skyrim's vanilla difficulty in any way, aside from ensuring that dragons have new abilities and dungeons match your level each time they respawn. CGO, LOTD, ZIM's, and the abundance of gear I put in here make you ridiculously powerful. What can I say, I need to be a hero in these troubling times. :sweatboy: Anyway, you will probably have to bump up the difficulty a lot (maybe even to Legendary) if you are at all good at Skyrim. (I'm not, and I made this list so I can test it by playing it.) The problem with this method is that followers are **buffed**, not nerfed, because they're considered _not-the-player_ and everything _not-the-player_ has its damaged multiplied. Combine this with player nerfs on Legendary and you'll find that with even one follower you never get a chance to hit anything before it's all dead. The only real answer for this is to use _Nether Follower Framework_ here and under _Follower Stats_ change their damage output to its lowest value: _0.10_. They'll be mostly harmless but at least you'll have your chance to shine.

### LOTD Settings

#### General

_Shipment Crate Locations_

Enable _Carriages_

Enable _Inns_

Enable _Player Homes_

###  Quick Light

_Brightness: Wide_

_Light Key: NUMPAD 1_

Uncheck _Enable to Long press activation key_

### Maids II: Deception

#### Settings

Disable _Wild Encounters_ as I did not install this option.

###  SexLab Aroused

#### Settings

_General_

Check _Enable SOS_.

#### Puppet Master

Here you will find an option (_Is Exhibitionist_) that will make your arousal rise dramatically the more people see you naked. With _Cursed Loot_, your life will quickly become a living hell.

#### Current Armor

The armor you wear will be listed here with a blank mark next to it. Click it to place an _X_ in the mark next and that outfit will be considered the same as being nude from that point on. Since _Spank That Ass_ only targets you for random ass slaps if you are nude or wearing clothing (as opposed to armor), you actually might want to do this if you are wearing something ridiculous that has cheeks hanging out.

### SexLab Confabulation

Not thoroughly tested but you might want to check out

#### Troubleshoot (the menu)

And disable things that aren't your thing.

**Please do this. Horses may be involved if you don't.**

###  SexLab Eager NPCs

####  General

Click _Enable and load profile - (CLICK)_. 

Upon receiving the message **Profile loaded successfully!** click _OK_ and close the MCM.

You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. 

Wait for two messages to appear in the upper left: **Mounted Exposure (SLEN) added** and **Masturbate (SLEN) added**.

###  SexLab Solutions

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

### SexLab Tools

#### Settings

_Matchmaker queue_

**Matchmaker queue key**: set to _NUMPAD 2_

Ignore the message that the key is already mapped and answer "Yes."

**Please Note**: You can hover your crosshair over any person and press _NUMPAD 2_ to set up a sex scene at any time with any animation without any consequences. Please note that the person in the _receiver_ slot is always the "bottom" in a sex scene or the "victim" in an aggressive scene. Every other slot is an _actor_ and will primarily have sex with the receiver although sometimes it varies. 

To add yourself to a slot, hover your crosshair over empty space and press _NUMPAD 2_. Then select the slot you want to participate in. Each time you place somebody in a slot, you will have to choose several options. _Set with animation_ obviously, then the type of animation you want. 

A "default" set is consensual, an "aggressive set" is non-consensual (or looks very much like it). However, both of these are limited to the first 250 animations installed per set, as per the original restrictions of _SexLab._ 

As for _Tag/Name_ if you know your animation's tag (for example, a common one like _MMF_ or _FFM_) then you can choose it and it will generally work. The name function is mostly useless unless you know the exact SLAL name of the animation you want to play. You could look it up I guess. 

Finally you'll have to type in how many total people will be in the scene. And yes, you have to do this _every time you add somebody_. It's not the best. 

Here's what makes up for it though, after you begin the scene by clicking on empty space and choosing _Begin scene_, you can press the _Shift+H_ keys to select from a list of commands, including changing positions, stages, and choosing animations from a list. Remember, it only draws from the first 250, or the first 250 of whatever tag you set. If your tag is too specific, nothing will be in the list.

###  Sky UI

####  General

_Item List_

**Font Size**: _Small_

_Active Effects HUD_

**Icon Size**: _Small_

### Spank That Ass

**Very important: This mod was made by a unique person who likes female spanking.**

**If you are a male character or don't like a healthy spanking now and again, you will want to uncheck the following**

#### Spanking

_Allow Sex Spanks_

_Allow Bump Spanks_

#### Player Dialogue

Set _Player Dialogue Level_ to _OFF_

**If you are female and want to get spanked**

Scroll down until you see

#### Import/Export Settings

Click _Import Settings_

**Last warning, if you do not disable the above you will get spanked and make female sex noises when having sex.**

###  Storm Lightning

####  Presets

Choose _Ultra Realistic_ and wait for it to say **DONE**

#### Advanced

Check Compatibility Mode

###  Trade & Barter

####  Barter Rates

_Settings_

Enable _Modify Barter Settings_

_Presets_

Select _Barter Presets: Medium_

### VioLens

#### Profile System

Click _Load - Select_.

A menu will appear. Select _VioLens_ and click _Exit_.

When you get the message "Are you sure you want to load?" click _Load_.

Wait a moment. You will see some stuff cycling. Then the message

_"VioLens.VLMS" Loaded_

Press _OK_

### XPMSE

Check _Disable Style Cloak Spell_

###  Defeat

**Please note, you will enable rape if you enable this. Do not do this if it offends you.**

**It is recommended to only enable this if you disabled _Cursed Loot_. If you insist on trying it, please return to the _Cursed Loot_ MCM and disable _Combat Surrender._**

Please ensure that you have configured every other MCM before this one.

Then save and load your game.

This is in case you need to change settings upon a restart, because Defeat must always be configured _last_.

####  General Settings

Click _Mod Status - DISABLED_

Upon receiving the message **Installing... you must close the menu and wait until you see the notification.** click _Accept_

Close the MCM and wait for the message **Defeat: Installed**. 

Re-open.

Next, click _Import Settings_ on the right.

**I have made all death into sexual assault with this mod. Sorry! If you don't like that, don't enable it. Better yet, read about the mod on Lover's Lab and customize it to your liking.**

If you die and you have an invalid aggressor (say a vampire while you have disabled creatures) then your game will lock up and cannot be continued. Reload the game. 

The advantage of this is you never have to worry about post-death save corruption! The disadvantage is: accidental grizzly bear penis (if you forgot to disable creatures). 

**Never use clean or reconfigure from Defeat's menu despite what other people tell you. I won't support game problems after these options are used. Reload the game instead.**

**Surrender functions are also enabled.**

To surrender to a hostile at any time, press the _K_ key. Do it fast because the script delay is excessive. Once they have their way with you they will leave you alone for about 20 seconds, giving you time to run, but you will be in a weakened state for about five minutes.

Only surrender to things you want to take advantage of you.

**I have disabled everything else. If you want to rape people or have everybody raping everybody else, please set it up yourself until your game breaks and you give up on it like everyone else.**

Keep in mind the silent takedown (with G) doesn't work with Nemesis so you'll have to mark them (again with G) and hit them with your fist instead. I won't go back to FNIS for the silent takedown.

## A bit of a note on schlongs and strap-ons

Rather than use _SexLab_'s rather boring and badly-fitted strapon for scenes were a female is mistakenly placed in male role, an Oldrim mod called _Equippable Schlong_ has been included. To configure its appearance, follow these steps:

1. Open the inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open the inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. Be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
11. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
12. Type in _TFC_.
13. Close the console with the same key.
14. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
15. Open the console again.
16. Type in _showracemenu_.
17. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
18. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
19. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
20. It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).
21. If you want to be a futa that's cool, but this particular schlong never unequips after a sex scene and can't have armor equipped over it, so there's that. You might want to take a look at _Cupid_ (another Wabbajack list) instead!
24. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

If you are male, the _Genitals_ section of _RaceMenu_ can be used to customize your "real" schlong as well.

Unfortunately I've not matched the equippable schlong to the Demoniac skin yet. It looks pretty off. But it's still better than Calyps.

## All done! I wash my hands of you now!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen, it helps if you give it a minute before trying). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. 

What's that you say? You don't want to be a bondage slut or any kind of slut, and want to start somewhere besides Helgen without being naked?

I suggest you reconsider why you are playing this modlist and disable Cursed Loot. You will find your answers there.
