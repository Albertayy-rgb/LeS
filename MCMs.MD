## Licentia et Servitium Configuration

## Character Creation

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard). There are no presets for Argonians and Khajiits for some reason. I made two male presets, a mage and a warrior, with an (M) after the name.

## A bit of a note on System Settings

I turned the music off. See below. You will also need to set your QuickSave and QuickLoad hotkeys, as Wabbajack does not change them.

### Audio

I have heard Jeremy Soule's default _Skyrim_ tracks so much that I am tired of them. I listen to something else. The music may be set to zero sometimes.

### Controls

These are all to your liking, except for _Quicksave_ which should be set to _F9_, and _Quickload_ which should be set to _F10_. Don't worry about using them becuase _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves.

I'm oldschool so sometimes I play with an inverted controller. If your controls are inverted you might have to change it since I forgot to.

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have both ceased appearing and disappearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing.

### SexLab

#### Install

Under **SexLab 1.63 SE dev beta 8 by Ashal@LoversLab.com**

Click _INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8_

Close the menu and wait. Once again, a series of messages will appear in the upper left corner. 

Do not touch the mouse or keyboard until the following message appears:

**SexLab - SexLab v1.63 SE dev beta 8 - Ready!**

Then open the MCM and continue.

### SexLab

####  Rebuild & Clean

Just below **Debug / Development Mode** in the upper right corner, click _Import Settings: Click Here_

A message will appear which concludes with "Do you want to continue?" Click _Accept_

Another message will appear, "SexLab configuration successfully imported." Click _Accept_

Finally, under **Available Strap-ons** near the lower left you will see _Calyps Strapon REMOVE_. Click this option and wait for it to disappear from the list of strap-ons.

#### Animation Settings

_**Creature animations are enabled by default**._ To prevent this, click _Allow creature animation_ in the upper right and make sure it's disabled. These are **not** limited to werewolves and vampires so be **sure** you want to get **freaky** before you allow it to remain enabled.

Finally, _SexLab_ is configured so that nude, opposite-sex characters cause you to become aroused by default. If you wish to change this, reopen the MCM and navigate to

### SexLab

#### Sex Diary / Journal

Under **Sexual stats** on the right, click _Sexuality_ until your preference (Bisexual, Gay, or Lesbian) appears.

### SAVE AND LOAD!

Lover's Lab recommends saving and loading the game immediately after fully configuring SexLab. Please do so now. If the QuickSave and QuickLoad buttons have changed, recall that they are now _F9_ and _F10_.

###  ZaZ Animation Pack

**If you are a male character, or have no interest in _Devious Devices_ or BDSM content, ignore this menu.**

**Last warning, taking the step below enables some bondage animations.**

####  SexLab

When first clicking this menu, it may appear to be stuck. It takes about a minute to show any visible change. Just wait. 

**SexLab Animations**: Click the grayed out word _Register_ and wait 30 - 60 seconds until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. 

Under **Animation**, uncheck _Override_ as Devious already handles this function.

###  SL Anim Loader

#### General Options

Click _Enable All: Click Here_

#### More Nasty Critters

These animations don't suit me. I recommend clicking _Disable All_. But to each their own.

#### General Options

Click _Register Animations_.

The process will take about five minutes, whereupon you will receive a message that over 500 animations have been registered.

Confirm and continue.

###  CGO

#### Settings

I have configured everything but the leaning and first person camera bobbing for you. Changing from one-handed to two-handed is done with the _Left Shift_ key. Dual-Wield Blocking is done with the _Scroll Wheel Button_ (or _MOUSE 3_). Dodge roll is set to _CTRL_ when moving. When standing still, you will crouch or uncrouch.

_Leaning_

I prefer the _procedural leaning_ and _camera movement_ (also known as **bobbing**) at X1.00, but it does cause rather severe motion sickness in some players.

**If you find uncomfortable nausea happening to you, I recommend the following values:**

_Lean Multiplier (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

_Lean Multiplier (3rd Person)_: _X1.00_

_Camera Noise_

_Camera Noise Mult (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

**You may also find that the first-person roll animation causes you to feel motion sick.**

Either disable it and set it to _Hotkey_ (with _ESC_ as the value) or switch to third person if you want to roll.

### Cursed Loot

**This mod includes extreme ERP (erotic roleplay) including BDSM and RAPE so if you do not wish to see such excessively offensive content you must DISABLE IT IMMEDIATELY as follows!**

First, import the default profile by navigating to 

#### Debug

And clicking _Import Settings_

This is necessary to disable some undesirable options I have off by default. They are left on even when the mod is shut down.

Next, disable bondage-related loot drops by navigating to 

#### Miscellaneous Options

And in the top right, set the following sliders to _0.0%_

_Restraints Drop Chance_

_Lucky Charm drop chance_

Still more loot to disable.

#### Escape Options

_Escape Options_

Uncheck _Container key drops enabled_

Uncheck _Dead body key drops enabled_

Finally, navigate to

#### Debug

And click _Shut down all functions_, then wait until it is checked.

**You will still loot DARE packs and DAMN boxes. These cannot be disabled and will cause unintended effects if used while Cursed Loot is disabled!**

#### Debug

**If you are a female character and wish to fight bondage gear almost as much as you do bandits do the following**

Click _Import Settings_ and upon receiving the message **Are you sure?** click _Accept_

**Last warning, if you have not disabled Cursed Loot at this moment you will randomly be tied up.**

**Last warning, if you are male and have not disabled Cursed Loot you will randomly go invisible.**

**If you have not read the entire landing page (README.md) go back and examine the section about "Combat Surrender" before continuing.**

### Devious Devices Helpers

**If you are a male character, or have no interest in BDSM content do the following**

#### Feature Enables

Uncheck _Follower asks to tie player_

You will still have bondage related dialogs in conversations with followers. Can't be helped, so don't select them.

**Last warning, if you do not do the above your follower will ask to tie you up every three days**

###  Follower Framework

####  System

In the upper right, click _Load From File - CLICK HERE_

At the message **Settings Loaded. Please exist the MCM menu to apply all changes.** click _Ok_

Exit the MCM and re-open it.

### LOTD Settings

#### General

_Shipment Crate Locations_

Enable _Carriages_

Enable _Inns_

Enable _Player Homes_

###  Quick Light

_Brightness: Wide_

_Light Key: NUMPAD 1_

Uncheck _Enable to Long press activation key_

### Radiant Prostitution

**NOTE** All settings are already configured but **do not** enable _Cursed Loot_ solicitation with this mod. The two are incompatible. This comes straight from the mod author's readme and I do not support this if you experiment with it.

###  SexLab Aroused

#### Settings

_General_

Check _Enable SOS_.

There is also an option in here that affects NPCs attitudes toward you, If you go to

#### Current Armor

And place an _X_ in the mark next to what you are wearing, it will be considered the same as being nude. Somewhat appropriate for some of the outfits in this list.

### SexLab Confabulation

Not thoroughly tested but you might want to check out

#### Troubleshoot (the menu)

And disable things that aren't your thing.

**Please do this. Horses may be involved if you don't.**

###  SexLab Eager NPCs

####  General

Click _Enable and load profile - (CLICK)_. 

Upon receiving the message **Profile loaded successfully!** click _OK_ and close the MCM.

You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. 

Wait for two messages to appear in the upper left: **Mounted Exposure (SLEN) added** and **Masturbate (SLEN) added**.

###  SexLab Solutions

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

### SexLab Tools

#### Settings

_Matchmaker queue_

**Matchmaker queue key**: set to _NUMPAD 2_

Ignore the message that the key is already mapped and answer "Yes."

**Please Note**: You can hover your crosshair over any actor and press _NUMPAD 2_ to set up a sex scene. Please note that the _first_ slot is always the _receiver_ in a sex scene. Every other slot is an _actor._. To add yourself to a slot, hover your crosshair over a nonliving object and press _NUMPAD 2_. Then select a slot. To begin the scene instead, select _Begin scene_. While a scene is running, you can press the _Shift+H_ keys to select from a list of commands.

###  Sky UI

####  General

_Item List_

**Font Size**: _Small_

_Active Effects HUD_

**Icon Size**: _Small_

### Spank That Ass

**Very important: This mod was made by a unique person who likes female spanking.**

**If you are a male character or don't like a healthy spanking now and again, you will want to uncheck the following**

#### Spanking

_Allow Sex Spanks_

_Allow Bump Spanks_

#### Player Dialogue

Set _Player Dialogue Level_ to _OFF_

**If you are female and want to get spanked**

Scroll down until you see

#### Import/Export Settings

Click _Import Settings_

**Last warning, if you do not disable the above you will get spanked and make female sex noises when having sex.**

The "Butchered" option for _Player Dialogue_ can be quite amusing but also very silly. I recommend changing it to "Vanilla" unless you just want to see how the text-to-speech style mashup works.

###  Storm Lightning

####  Presets

Choose _Ultra Realistic_ and wait for it to say **DONE**

#### Advanced

Check Compatibility Mode

###  Trade & Barter

####  Barter Rates

_Settings_

Enable _Modify Barter Settings_

_Presets_

Select _Barter Presets: Medium_

### VioLens

#### Profile System

Click _Load - Select_.

A menu will appear. Select _VioLens_ and click _Exit_.

When you get the message "Are you sure you want to load?" click _Load_.

Wait a moment. You will see some stuff cycling. Then the message

_"VioLens.VLMS" Loaded_

Press _OK_

### XPMSE

Check _Disable Style Cloak Spell_

###  Defeat

**Please note, you will enable sexual assault if you enable this. Do not do this if it offends you.**

**It is recommended to only enable this if you disabled _Cursed Loot_. If you insist on trying it, please return to the _Cursed Loot_ MCM and disable _Combat Surrender._**

Please ensure that you have configured every other MCM before this one.

Then save and load your game.

This is in case you need to change settings upon a restart, because Defeat must always be configured _last_.

####  General Settings

Click _Mod Status - DISABLED_

Upon receiving the message **Installing... you must close the menu and wait until you see the notification.** click _Accept_

Close the MCM and wait for the message **Defeat: Installed**. 

Re-open.

Next, click _Import Settings_ on the right.

**I have made all death into sexual assault with this mod. Sorry! If you don't like that, don't enable it. Better yet, read about the mod on Lover's Lab and customize it to your liking.**

If you die and you have an invalid aggressor (say a vampire while you have disabled creatures) then your game will lock up and cannot be continued. Reload the game. 

The advantage of this is you never have to worry about post-death save corruption! The disadvantage is: accidental grizzly bear penis (if you forgot to disable creatures). 

**Never use clean or reconfigure from Defeat's menu despite what other people tell you. I won't support game problems after these options are used. Reload the game instead.**

**Surrender functions are also enabled.**

To surrender to a hostile at any time, press the _K_ key. Do it fast because the script delay is excessive. Once they have their way with you they will leave you alone for about 20 seconds, giving you time to run, but you will be in a weakened state for about five minutes.

Only surrender to things you want to take advantage of you.

**Stealth defeats (coming from behind with the _G_ key to instant knockdown) do not work with Nemesis.**

I experimented with an _FNIS_ build to allow for this but decided it was stupid to return to an unsupported animation engine and evict CGO just because of this one "feature".

If you must assault someone, mark them with _G_ and hit them with an unarmed attack.

Please note that anyone else who sees you may attack you when you do this.

One they are incapacitated you can activate them with _E_ and roleplay your heart out.

## A bit of a note on schlongs and strap-ons

Rather than use _SexLab_'s rather boring and badly-fitted strapon for scenes were a female is mistakenly placed in male role, an Oldrim mod called _Equippable Schlong_ has been included. To configure its appearance, follow these steps:

1. Open the inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open the inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. Be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
11. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
12. Type in _TFC_.
13. Close the console with the same key.
14. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
15. Open the console again.
16. Type in _showracemenu_.
17. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
18. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
19. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
20. It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).
21. If you want to be a futa that's cool, but this particular schlong never unequips after a sex scene and can't have armor equipped over it, so there's that. You might want to take a look at _Cupid_ (another Wabbajack list) instead!
24. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

If you are male, the _Genitals_ section of _RaceMenu_ can be used to customize your "real" schlong as well.

Unfortunately I've not matched the equippable schlong to the Demoniac skin yet. It looks pretty off. But it's still better than Calyps.

## All done! I wash my hands of you now!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen, it helps if you give it a minute before trying). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. If you don't like the lusty starting options I made for you, come to #licentia-et-servitium support on Wabbajack's Discord and say the safe word "Svirfneblin" and I will tell you how to get them all back. Please note: many of them are disabled for good reasons. Don't worry, as long as you have the save from before you talked to the statue, you will not have to do the MCMs over again.
