<h1>Licentia et Servitium: A Double-Sided Coin of Lover's Lab</h1>

# A STRONG WARNING

## Devious SE is still in **late beta!** Expect bugs!

If you encounter _anything_ that you even _think_ is wrong, **especially** if you are playing the _Light But Kinky_ variant, please refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) before asking on Github or Discord. Many of the most common questions are answered there. The signature mods in that build contain bugs, but are still playable, and will only improve with time.

#  Requirements

It's recommended that you sign up for a Premium account on _The Nexus_ for five bucks a month (http://nexusmods.com)

Otherwise you'll have to download every file manually and put it in the right folder.

Also you'll need a Lover's Lab account (http://loverslab.com)

Also, with the addition of the _Devious_ group of mods, you may wish to sign up for _MEGA_ as well, given that throttling and caps are in place for anonymous users. (http://mega.co.nz)

And, this is the last one I swear, you'll want to sign up at Vector Plexus for the awesome High-Poly Head, it's definitely worth it. (https://vectorplexus.com/)

#  System Specs

I currently use a rather beefy machine with an RTX card, but my previous machine had these specs: _Intel i7-4790k, 16GB DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1080_, and it was perfectly sufficient for this modlist as well as most others on Wabbajack, even though load times were a bit excessive. The most important gatekeepers are probably at least 6GB VRAM and an SSD for loading everything into memory and _especially_ hashing files for installation and upgrades. 

# Installation

This section is shamelessly copied and pasted from erri120's excellent Lotus readme. I hope he doesn't object.

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to Updating.

####  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

####  Steam Config

**Disable the Steam Overlay**

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the General tab and un-tick the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game checkbox.

Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to Only update this game when I launch it. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

Set the Game language to English

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. You can also use Skyrim Shredder by trawz that will clean your installation.

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on Ultra
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Off
    Uncheck Windowed Mode and Borderless

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

###  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

    Open Wabbajack
    Load the Modlist from Disk
    Adjust the download and installation paths
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step.

####  Post-Installation

**Copy Game Folder Files**

Download the latest ENB Series from <a href="http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm">here</a> and copy d3d11.dll and d3dcompiler_46e.dll to your game folder.

Copy all of the files from the MO2/game folder files directory to your game folder.

##  Updating

**If you are in the middle of a playthrough, DO NOT UPDATE unless something in your game is broken.**

**It is possible that you will have problems with an old save if you update and then try to play very long with it.**

First, check the Changelog before doing anything. If you are not interested in the changes, or they do not address a bug you are having, **do not update**.

If you're going to ignore my advice and try to continue a save anyway, copy out the entire _profiles_ folder within the _LeS_ directory to somewhere **you will remember.**

Next, **move** the _BodySlide Output_ folder within the _mods_ folder to the root directory that _LeS_ is on (otherwise it'll take forever). **Importantly, remember where you did this.**

**This is your final warning, Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

**To confirm: all saves, BodySlide customizations, and additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!**

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

When the update is complete, **move** the _profiles_ folder back into the _LeS_ folder and choose **not** to overwrite. (Your saves will be restored but any configurations changed by the update will be kept.)

Next **delete** the _profiles_ folder leftovers from your backup, as they only have old and useless files.

Finally, **move** the _BodySlide Output_ folders back into the _mods_ folder and **do** choose to overwrite in case I've bone-headedly left something in there.

You should be ready to continue as per the installation instructions.

##  LBS vs. LBK, How Do I Choose?

Your kinks are a very private thing. There's no way I can create a list that appeals to everyone, so I have included two lists each centered around the most common uses for Lover's Lab for you to choose from.

_Light But Sexy_ is the default list, primarily intended to offer the option to have sex with attractive people as you play through a significantly modded Skyrim. Those choosing to play male characters or non-submissive females should choose this option so they don't find themselves intruded upon. Sexy roleplay is available via _Amorous Adventures_ which features full voice acting (despite incredibly cheesy dialog and quests), _SexLab Solutions_ which lets you pass varying skill checks by offering your (or your follower's) body, and _SexLab Eager NPCS_ (also known as "SLEN") which uses a rudimentary seduction system to improve your relationship with others via sex. Defeat, although fairly buggy as a death alternative, is also included to make combat sacrifices an option.

_Light But Kinky_ is the sublist for the well, kinky among us, and it is all about the _Cursed Loot_. Basically you will be fighting against magical traps that lock you in various restraining devices with little hope of escape, making yourself available to be exploited by anyone who might happen to be around. Given that _Devious Devices_ have no male body models (or only very limited ones) and you will find yourself having a lot of shall we say, "involuntary" sex, this modlist is only recommended for female submissive characters. _Cursed Loot_ also has a death and surrender alternative with of course further bondage options, and rudimentary creature support is included for the monster fans.

_Light But Sexy_ is enabled by default. To switch to the sublist, select it from the main "profiles" dropdown in the center-top of MO2. No further steps are required.

##  Building Bodies and Armors with BodySlide

All the armors in this list are huge in size. The custom fits are not included by default.

**You MUST run BodySlide on your own before you launch Skyrim or weird stuff will happen. This _can_ and _will_ include people wearing purple underwear, people varying in size depending on what clothes they wear, and more.**


1. First, **MAKE CERTAIN YOU ARE ON LIGHT BUT SEXY.** Those armors should be done first.
2. Launch _BodySlide_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, where you can find a dropdown with items such as _SKSE_, _Skyrim_ and the _Skyrim Launcher_. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Select your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.	
7. Choose the body you want from the _Preset_ menu. (You can see what it looks like by hitting the **Preview** button. I recommend the one called "3BBB HangEmHigh.")	
8. Disable the mod called _bodygen3_ in Mod Organizer 2's left pane. You'll find it at or near position **395**, just below _SKSE Settings._
9. If you want to try an experimental _BodyGen_ feature, where each lady you meet has different measurements, leave _bodygen3_ **ENABLED** instead.	
10. If you do leave BodyGen enabled, you **MUST** use the preset called _- Zeroed Sliders -_ or the body randomization will not work properly.
11. Click the check box for _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left	
12. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
13. You will see a huge list of bodies and armors. Just click _Build_.
14. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted armors. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**
15. Now you will have a massive list of options to choose from which are mandatory, so be patient. 
16. For the first option, choose **SE 3BBB Body Amazing**
17. Always choose **3BA** before any other option.
18. I recommend the **PRIMARY** "variant" over anything marked **2** (as in "BD 3BF Dragonbone boots 2"). Keep in mind, anything marked **recommended** is ultimately up to you. You can always preview the outfit and decide for yourself.	
19. Second in priority should be **3BF**
20. Several helmets will have a hair color option. It only affects hair color poking out of a few helmets. This is personal choice.
21. A few boots wiil feature **flat** options. This essentially means **no high heels.** The other variants have high heels. I recommend the **flat** variants so characters line up correctly with furniture.	
22. There is one helmet (**glass**) that has a closed or open faced variant. I recommend open.
23. Several boots have **low** variants which I recommend due to the high probability of clipping on the variants with stockings.
24. The Nocturnal dress has a normal or **minidress** variant. The latter I recommend. It's a bit sexier.
25. I recommend the **prisoner bikini** over the **prisoner clothes**.
26. I recommend the **prisoner rag short** over the **prisoner rag**.
27. There are several variants with **shoes** or **boots**. I recommend **shoes** to reduce the likelihood of clipping.
28. I recommend the **vanilla** wedding dress variant. The normal one is sexier but has a weird lengthy strip that can behave strangely at times.
29. I recommmend the **prisoner bikini** for DLC1, but for a little variety I invite you to examine the outfits and choose one you like.
30. Whether your armor has fur trim or not is really up to you.
31. Press **Build** and wait for all the outfits to be built.
32. If you have _no interest_ in the _Light But Kinky_ variant, you are now finished. Skip to step **44**.
33. If you wish to play _Light But Kinky_, read on.
34. First, **SWITCH TO THE LIGHT BUT KINKY VARIANT.**
35. Click the small **magnifying glass** in the upper right corner of _BodySlide_ next to a dropdown box.
36. Select "Ghoose groups..." from the dropdown.
37. Enter checkboxes in every box starting with _Cursed Loot_ all the way down to _Devious Devices 4.3 AIO 3BA - Outfit (Pushup)_
38. Enter a checkbox in the box next to _Unassigned_.
39. Press **OK**
40. Repeat steps **6 - 11**.
41. Always choose **3BA** before any other option.
42. Always choose **DDX - UUNP/CBBE** over **DDX - UUNP CBBE**
43. Press **Build** and wait for the rest of the outfits to be built.
44. You should now be ready to launch Skyrim with the _SKSE_ option under the _Executables_ dropdown.

##  A Note on SexLab for the Uninitiated

Skyrim was never designed to have animations injected into it. It most certainly was never intended to pair two actors in a close space and perfectly align them for a sex scene. Animators do a lot of the work, but the engine is far from ideal. On top of that, there are many poorly aligned animations out there. A couple are even in the default SexLab package from Oldrim, and have never been corrected or removed. In any case, no matter how good your animations, you will often find problems like: people kissing the air, _parts_ not going _into_ each other, characters floating above the ground, or even more wacked-out stuff like falling into the ground, clipping into furniture, or people going invisible. Fortunately (if not annoyingly), SexLab allows you to correct _some_ of this with manual positioning for each animation. Here's how it works... the _L_ key on your keyboard moves you _forward,_ i.e. closer to your partner. _Shift-L_ moves you _backward,_ or the reverse. _;_ moves you _up_, or higher in elevation than your partner. _Shift-;_ does the reverse. Finally, _'_ moves you _Right_ compared to your partner, whereas _Shift-'_ moves you _Left_. (Or maybe the other left.) Get used to these, you'll be using them a lot.

##  Admiring Yourself

For those who want a little POV action or to play primarily in first person, _IFPV_ (Immersive First-Person View) is included. It's a little wonky, so it's disabled by default. Ensure you're in first person mode (F key by default) and press _NUMPAD 0_ to enable it. Then press the first person key again and look downward. Tah-Dah! Should work tolerably well for POV scenes (maybe a bit of clipping) except for animations where the actors are _really_ close to each other. To switch to _vanilla_ first person for gameplay, hit the change view key at any time. 

**This means that you cannot switch to third person anymore without deactivating IFPV with _NUMPAD 0_!**

Remember you can always watch a scene from an external view with SexLab's default freecam available with _NUMPAD 3_.

##  Specific to Light But Sexy

###  Defeat

Defeat is ... a little buggy, to say the least... but I have included it in _Light But Sexy_ as a potential death alternative. I have most of it disabled because it breaks too often and forces a reload. About the only things left active in my setup are the ability to "surrender" with the _K_ key, or assault people with the _H_ key as per Defeat's description. Do them as soon as you're outnumbered if you want a scene because the delay can be excessive. If you want to enable more of it feel free, but be prepared for situations such as being stuck to the ground, unable to move, stuck to the ground _and_ unable to move, or unable to interact with anything or open your inventory.

##  Specific to Light But Kinky

###  Cursed Loot

The thing you have to remember about _Cursed Loot_ is that, once its in your modlist, your game is no longer about Skyrim and it is now about Cursed Loot. It does everything from overhauling loot, to adding followers, to changing combat and buffs, to prostitution, to prison overhaul, to death alternatives. It even has an alternate start and other quests to help you get a feel for how the mod works. Once you activate _Light But Kinky_, I have provided two gameplay options for this mod. Both are enabled to ensure they are downloaded but one is hidden. The first (and recommended) option is _Cursed Loot Lenient_ which you will see under **Outputs** in the left pane. Leave everything untouched for infrequent, mild encounters with bondage gear that's relatively easy to escape from until you hit level 20 where things start getting a bit more hardcore. If you are a glutton for punishment and enjoy walking extremely slowly while tied up and clicking menus over and over in an attempt to escape, double-click on _Cursed Loot Punishing._, go to the _FileTree_ tab at the top, and find the _JSON_ file that has _mohidden_ at the end and choose _Unhide_. When you finally get sick of it and wish to go back to lenient, repeat the process except choose _Hide._ It's probably best to treat this as a nightmarish survival mode that you should only play to avoid your invitable enslavement or imprisonment for as long as possible before starting over. The key "mechanic" of this mod (such as it is) is that you keep your arousal down via sexual acts to prevent "cursed traps" from triggering that lock you into bondage gear, make you more aroused, spiraling down into a self-defeating loop. For more details I suggest you do a little searching on LoversLab.com for the Cursed Loot landing page and read up on it. It shouldn't be difficult to find, it's about the most popular mod there.

##  Adding Followers, Outfits, and Other Mods

This is not "officially" supported as per Wabbajack Rule 11. I may or may not help you do so anyway (in the Licentia support channel) depending on how busy I am. It is expected that you have familiarity with Mod Organizer 2, xEdit, FNIS, Nemesis, and a touch of conflict resolution before you try to do anything beyond basic outfit additions.

# Game MCM Options

**NOTE**: Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have ceased appearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing. Even after they have stopped, give it another five or ten seconds, just in case.

##  SexLab

Under **Install**

Click **INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8**

Close the menu and wait for a message in the upper left corner informing you that SexLab is ready. Then open the MCM and continue.

###  Sex Diary

**Sexuality: Your choice.**

Only determines with sex causes your arousal level to increase if you see them naked.

###  Rebuild & Clean

Click **Import Settings: Click Here**

It should confirm this choice, wait for the message.

If you are playing _Light But Kinky_ **and** wish to experience potentially involuntary encounters with non-humanoid entities, enable _Creature Animations_ on the _Animation Settings_ page, close the menus, and wait until the _Enabled_ message appears **twice**.

**A bit of a note on strap-ons**

It seems that strap-ons are universally loathed among the Skyrim NSFW community, but SexLab loves them in female scenes and likes to use them at every opportunity if they are enabled. So I have included an old and forgotten Oldrim mod called "equippable schlong" available in the **Rebuild/Clean Menu**. It basically attaches a full SOS schlong to female characters with physics and collisions instead of a strap-on and is fully customizable from Racemenu. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Go back to **Rebuild/Clean**
2. Disable the terrible SexLab strapon by clicking **Calyps Strapon - Remove**
3. Close the MCM and open your inventory
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon)
6. Close and re-open your inventory
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled)
9. If you are running _Light But Kinky_ be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked
10. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`)
11. Type in _TFC_
12. Close the console with the same key
13. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side
14. Open the console again
15. Type in _showracemenu_
16. Navigate over to _Genitals_
17. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit
18. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
19. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this.)

##  A Matter of Time

###  Presets

Click **User Settings: Load User Settings**

Answer yes and wait for confirmation.

##  AGO

###  Settings

The only one you need to de-select is **Persistent Arrows.**

##  CGO

###  Settings

Set **Hotkey** to _Shift._ This enables you to use any weapon one or two handed. Keep in mind that the way you wield a weapon affects how you skill up, e.g. two-handed grip levels up two-handed, etc. Dual-wielding bacon is not yet an option.

Alter **Speed Change** and **Stationary Speed Boost** down a notch to 20% to reduce the power level of CGO.

**Enable iFrames** for a little Souls-ish gameplay.

I like the procedural 1.00 leaning, but if it seems a bit silly to you, toning it back to 0.50 might be more appropriate.

##  Cursed Loot

Only available with _Light But Kinky_.

This mod will act wildly different depending on whether you enabled the _Lenient_ or _Punishing_ preset in MO2. In either case, go to

###  Debug

And hit **Import Settings** and confirm.

##  Deadly Dragons

These boys are plenty hard on Vanilla, so just remove **Knockdown** from their abilities.

##  Devious Device Helpers

Only available with _Light But Kinky_.

This is a lot to take in so just disable the random bondage option for Shops and Other Dwellings. Just keep in mind if your follower asks to tie you up to give it some serious thought!

##  Devious Devices

Only available with _Light But Kinky_.

Tailor this to your _Cursed Loot_ preset. If you are running "Punishing" just leave everything as it is. If you are running "Lenient" I recommend tuning all the difficulties to **Vanilla**, **Disable Lock Jam**, set **Blindfold Strength** to 0.10 and **Dark Fog Strength** to 200, disable **Boots Slowdown Effect**, **Hardcore Bondage Mittens** and set **Hobble Skirt Debuff Strength** to 25, which is the lowest (fastest movement) it will go.

##  Extended UI

Check **Hide Legendary UI elements**, **Show attribute modifiers**, and **Show skill modifiers**.

##  FEC

###  Player Effects

You could spend all day in here so I just recommend enabling **Soul Absorb**.

##  Follower Framework

###  System

Hit **Load From File** and exit the menu. Then re-enter.

You might want to check out the hotkeys to see what they've been set to. They're inspired by our overlord.

###  Notes

Keep in mind that if you play with _Light But Kinky_, you're going to have to come back here to the **Follower Tweaks** menu and use the **Default Combat** package for any followers you use. Otherwise the death alternative scenes will never trigger.

In either variant, many followers may be overpowered (especially Chloe), so if you find yourself being outshined, visit the same menu and disable all the **Stealth** options, as well as nerfing overall damage to **0.50** or even **0.10**. 

##  GIST Soul Trap

Just enable **Show message on soul trapped**

##  Quick Light

Set **Type of Light Source** to _Lantern_

**Brightness** to _Wide

**Light Key** to _NUMPAD 1_

##  Sacrosanct Vampires

Only thing you need to tick here is **Fortitude: Disable**

##  SexLab Aroused

Hit **Purge Dead Actors Every 10 Game Days** and **Enable SOS**.

##  SexLab Eager NPCs

Only available with _Light But Sexy_. 

###  General

Hit **Enable and load profile**. You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. Exit the MCM and wait for two abilities to be added, then open it and continue.

##  SexLab LightMeUp

This mod is finickly on defaults, largely because if you are using QuickLight to explore a dark area, it thinks the area is bright and won't activate. QuickLight is intended to light your surroundings, not your character, so this isn't ideal.

###  Settings

Tick **Toggle Manual Control**

Ensure that **Lights Always On/Off** is active.

I would prefer assigning a hotkey to turn lights on and off as the user wishes, but this mod won't allow you to do so during a scene.

If this mod and QuickLight are both shining, you can always turn off QuickLight anytime.

##  SexLab Solutions

Only available with _Light But Sexy_. 

###  Followers

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

###  Miscellaneous

**Integration**: click _SLEN integration_

##  Sky UI

###  General

**Font Size** to _Small_

Disable **Active Effects HUD**

###  Controls

Set the first four **Favorite Groups** to _F5 - F8_ to avoid a conflict with follower commands.

##  SL Anim Loader

###  General Options

Press **Enable All: Click Here**

Press **Register Animations: Click Here**

Wait for the "Registered X new animations" message. Be patient, it can take up to five minutes.

##  SLA Monitor Widget

###  Scanner Settings

Customize the scanner to your taste. It will tell you who (or what) is horny and how much. If you are only interested in females, choose that option. If you are only interested in humanoids, choose that option. It's up to you.

I must insist that you set **Interval** of no lower than _60_ and a **Range** of no greater than _1024_.

###  Widget Looks

Recommend **Vertical Anchor** of _Center_ and **Font size** of _16 PTS._

This takes a bit too. Exit the MCM and re-enter.

##  Storm Lightning

###  Presets

Chose **Ultra Realistic** and wait for it to say _DONE_

##  Trade & Barter

###  Barter Rates

Enable **Modify Barter Settings**

Select **Barter Presets: Medium**

##  Ultimate Combat

###  General

Disable **Speed Bonus.**

Under **Stagger**, disable or set all options to zero to avoid conflicts with **AGO**.

Also disable all checkboxes under **Locational Damage.**

###  NPC Setting

**NPC**

Select **Dodge: Disable** or you'll have conflicts with CGO.

##  Wildcat Combat

Be sure to press

**Disable Dynamic Combat**

Because it causes a lot of weird sheathing / unsheathing loops with CGO, conflicts with AGO's native bow stamina and interrupt mechanics, and also doesn't play well with Ultimate Combat's Timed Block. 

Under **Difficulty** hit _Allow Wildcat to Manage Difficulty_ so you don't have overpowered followers.

##  Defeat

Only available with _Light But Sexy_.

###  General Settings

First hit **Install Mod.** Close the MCM and wait for the message _Defeat: Installed_. 

Re-open.

Next, hit **Import Settings** on the right.

##  ZaZ Animation Pack

Only available with _Light But Kinky_.

###  General

Don't change anything if you're on "Punishing." Otherwise, set **Bound Hands** to _Light Struggle,_ **Shackled Movement Speed** to 100%, and **Blindfold Amount** and **Pulse** to 10%.

###  SexLab

This menu takes a good minute to appear after you click on it. It may seem stuck. Just wait. Afterward, hit **SexLab Animations: Register** and wait a good bit until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. Then uncheck the **Override** as Devious already handles this function.

##  SSSO

Before configuring this section, be sure to **Save Manually from the System Menu** so you can come back here and start a fresh, fully configured game if you so desire. You **will not** be able to change genders or races with RaceMenu or your whole save will break beyond repair. To change genders or races, you will have to start over from square one with a new game and configure all the menus again. I know, it sucks, but it can't be helped.

Set options as follows:

**Minimum interval: 5 MINUTES**

**Manual Save Key: F9**

Enable **Rotating Automatic Save**

Enable **Rotating Manual Save**

Allow autosaves to handle all saves except in the rarest of cases. If a manual save is absolutely necessary, only save with this mod's F9 hotkey. Only load your most recent save. This helps prevent save corruption from saving and reloading too much. You may not like it, but you'll like a dead save that no longer loads after 400 hours of play even less.

# All done!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. If you are on _Light But Sexy_, I recommend one of the _Something Sexy_ starts (dropped nude into a sticky situation) and if you are on _Light But Kinky_, I recommend the _Sex Slave_ start for a good look into how _Cursed Loot_ works. Spoiler though, there is no sex, just lots of bondage gear. 

However you choose to enjoy NSFW Skyrim, soft or hard, I hope your experience is fulfilling (or at least titillating.) Keep checking the NSFW channels for releases including _Cupid_, _Lotus_ and _Bakarim_ which are far more in-depth than I can muster.

#  Troubleshooting

##  Why don't my saves work?

Now that I understand how it works and the advantages it offers, the Skyrim Save System Overhaul is in here, not to punish you as suspected, but to allow for automatic saving without the problems that would break a lot of the background scripting of this modlist. Set it as specified in the MCM section and forget it. If you die, exit the game, relaunch it, and continue from the main menu. Try to avoid using the hotkey to save as I _have_ had Cursed Loot break on me by using it. You'll get back to where you were soon, the saves happen at roughly five minute intervals when everything "calms down" in the background. If you really want to risk an after-death reload, wait until the 15 second countdown and autoload has elapsed. Hopefully this will prevent the dreaded save corruption. _Only the most recent 5 manual saves and 10 autosaves are stored, and their names and screenshots do not depict their contents. Use the most recent one unless absolutely necessary._

##  What are all these Form 43 warnings? I thought Form 43 was bad news. 

In the normal modding world this would be true, but this is Lover's Lab, which is notoriously resistant to change. Some of the mods have issues if they are converted. So **do not attempt to convert the Form 43 plugins into form 44**! These are left this way intentionally. I can't stop MO2 from warning you about them but I can strongly insist that you not act on those warnings.

##  My skin pokes through my armor! or My bald head pokes through my hood!

Particularly voluptuous (thicc) BodySlide presets will cause clipping (skin poking through clothing) on some outfit variants that are skintight. This may include randomized women from BodyGen. Nothing can be done about this so either ignore it or generate everyone with a more subdued BodySlide preset. 

There are also issues with some hoods causing bald heads to poke through that I have yet to resolve. This mostly happens when the PC wears a hooded robe and crouches, so if it bothers you, don't do either of those things.

## CGO isn't leaning / dodging! _or_ When I go into an adult scene, I hear sounds and voices but they just stand there!

I sometimes forget to run _Nemesis_ before uploading a build. Smack me on Github or in the channel and I'll do it. If you don't want to wait follow these instructions.

1. Choose whichever variant you wish to play, _Light But Sexy_ or _Light But Kinky_
2. **Ensure that all FNIS mods are disabled in the left pane. Yes, this includes FNIS Output.**
3. Select  _Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine_ from the _Executables_ drop down box (same place as _SKSE_ and _BodySlide_)
4. Press **RUN**
5. **Only for _Light But Sexy_**: Ensure that _Archery Gameplay Overhaul_, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE_, _360 Movement Behavior SE_, _Gender Specific Animations_, and _Ultimate Combat / TK Dodge_ are all **CHECKED**
6. **Only for _Light But Kinky_**: Ensure that _Archery Gameplay Overhaul_, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE_, _Gender Specific Animations_, and _Ultimate Combat / TK Dodge_ are all **CHECKED**
7. Press **Update Engine**. Be patient, it can sometimes take upwards of three minutes.
8. Once you receive the message "Engine Update Complete," press **Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine.** This will also require patience.
9. When you receive the "Complete" message, close the Engine with the _X_ box.
10. **Only for _Light But Kinky_**: Re-enable _FNIS Output_ in the left pane.
11. You are ready to play _Skyrim_ by choosing _SKSE_ from the _Executables_ drop down box and pressing **RUN**

##  I did all that but the things are still just standing there, especially when I get attacked.

The automatic animations triggered from Devious Devices and Cursed Loot seem to suffer from almost intolerable script lag at times. I understand it's a known issue that is being worked on, but until it is resolved, you'll have to break your immersion a bit. If an animation seems stuck **and** there are no moans of pleasure, just various breathing and grunts (or silence), open the console with the tilde key (`), wait for all messages to cycle, then close the console again. You may have to repeat this process at least once.

##  I'm locked into some gear and I can't move in third person.

Finally, sometimes the PC will become unable to move after picking up items in 3rd person due to the fidgety way that Cursed Loot uses encumbrance to slow you down. If this happens, simply go into first person and back out to move again.
