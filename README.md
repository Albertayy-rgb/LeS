<h1>Licentia et Servitium: A Double-Sided Coin of Lover's Lab</h1>

# A STRONG WARNING

## Devious SE is still in **late beta!** Expect bugs!

If you encounter _anything_ that you even _think_ is wrong, **especially** if you are playing the _Light But Kinky_ variant, please refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) before asking on Github or Discord. Many of the most common questions are answered there. The signature mods in that build contain bugs, but are still playable, and will only improve with time.

#  Requirements

It's recommended that you sign up for a Premium account on _The Nexus_ for five bucks a month (http://nexusmods.com).

Otherwise you'll have to download every file manually and put it in the right folder.

You'll need a Lover's Lab account (http://loverslab.com).

Also, with the addition of the _Devious_ group of mods, you may wish to sign up for _MEGA_ as well, given that throttling and caps are in place for anonymous users. (http://mega.co.nz)

And, this is the last one I swear, you'll want to sign up at Vector Plexus for the awesome High-Poly Head, it's definitely worth it. (https://vectorplexus.com/)

#  System Specs

I currently use a rather beefy machine with an RTX card, but my previous machine had these specs: _Intel i7-4790k, 16GB DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1080_, and it was perfectly sufficient for this modlist as well as most others on Wabbajack, even though load times were a bit excessive. The most important gatekeepers are probably at least 6GB VRAM and an SSD for loading everything into memory and _especially_ hashing files for installation and upgrades. 

# Installation

This section is shamelessly copied and pasted from _erri120_'s excellent _Lotus_ readme. I hope he doesn't object.

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating.** (#updating)

####  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

####  Steam Config

**Disable the Steam Overlay**

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the General tab and un-tick the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game checkbox.

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. If you have download throttles or caps, or just don't want to wait, you can also use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133">Skyrim Shredder</a> by trawz to clean your installation.

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and have a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on Ultra
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Off
    Uncheck Windowed Mode and Borderless

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

###  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

    Open Wabbajack
    Load the Modlist from Disk
    Adjust the download and installation paths
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update to the modlist is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step.

**MEGA files stuck at _100%_**

The files from MEGA are very large and must be verified. Please be extremely patient and allow each file to hash for at least 30 minutes, up to two hours if you are not using a solid-state drive. If you are certain you can't download the files any other way, try manual download from the Manifest in Wabbajack's lower-left corner.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. I'm afraid you'll have to wait 24h and try again.

**Wabbajack cannot continue because of unknown files.**

Move your downloads folder outside of your _LeS_ folder, ensure the _LeS_ folder is clear of all files, then close and restart Wabbajack. Be sure to point the downloads box to your relocated downloads folder.

####  Post-Installation

**Copy Game Folder Files**

Download the latest ENB Series from <a href="http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm">here</a> and copy d3d11.dll and d3dcompiler_46e.dll to your game folder.

Copy all of the files from the MO2/game folder files directory to your game folder.

**Deactivate FNIS**

_Fore's New Idles in Skyrim_ must be _enabled_ for Wabbajack to download it, but _disabled_ to play this modlist without issues. To do so, uncheck everything related to _FNIS_ if you are using _Light But Sexy._ If you are using _Light But Kinky_, disable everything but _FNIS Output_.

##  Updating

**If you are in the middle of a playthrough, DO NOT UPDATE unless something in your game is broken.**

**It is possible that you will have problems with an old save if you update and then try to play very long with it.**

First, check the Changelog before doing anything. If you are not interested in the changes, or they do not address a bug you are having, **do not update**.

If you're going to ignore my advice and try to continue a save anyway, copy out the entire _profiles_ folder within the _LeS_ directory to somewhere **you will remember.**

Next, **move** the _BodySlide Output_ folder within the _mods_ folder to the root directory that _Licentia et Servitium_ is on (otherwise it'll take forever). **Importantly, remember where you did this.**

**This is your final warning, Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

**To confirm: all saves, BodySlide customizations, and additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!**

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

When the update is complete, **move** the _profiles_ folder back into the _Licentia et Servitium_ folder and choose **not** to overwrite. (Your saves will be restored but any configurations changed by the update will be kept.)

Next **delete** the _profiles_ folder leftovers from your backup, as they only have old and useless files.

Finally, **move** the _BodySlide Output_ folders back into the _mods_ folder and **do** choose to overwrite in case I've bone-headedly left something in there.

You should be ready to continue as per the installation instructions.

##  LBS vs. LBK, How Do I Choose?

Your kinks are a very private thing. There's no way I can create a list that appeals to everyone, so I have included two lists each centered around the most common uses for Lover's Lab for you to choose from.

_Light But Sexy_ is the primary list, primarily intended to offer the option to have sex with attractive people as you play through a significantly modded Skyrim. Those choosing to play male characters or non-submissive females should choose this option so they don't find themselves intruded upon. Sexy roleplay is available via _Amorous Adventures_ which features full voice acting (despite incredibly cheesy dialog and quests), _SexLab Solutions_ which lets you pass varying skill checks by offering your (or your follower's) body, and _SexLab Eager NPCS_ (also known as "SLEN") which uses a rudimentary seduction system to improve your relationship with others via sex. Defeat, although fairly buggy as a death alternative, is also included to make combat sacrifices an option.

_Light But Kinky_ is the sublist for the well, kinky among us, and it is all about the _Cursed Loot_. Basically you will be fighting against magical traps that lock you in various restraining devices with little hope of escape, making yourself available to be exploited by anyone who might happen to be around. Given that _Devious Devices_ have no male body models (or only very limited ones) and you will find yourself having a lot of shall we say, "involuntary" sex, this modlist is only recommended for female submissive characters. _Cursed Loot_ also has a death and surrender alternative with of course further bondage options, and rudimentary creature support is included for the monster fans.

Even though it is far more niche, _Light But Kinky_ is enabled by default. This is because more armors need to be built for it and I wished to consolidate all steps. If you wish to play _Light But Sexy_, first complete the steps in [Building Bodies and Armors with BodySlide](#building-bodies-and-armors-with-bodyslide) and then select _Light But Sexy_ from the main "profiles" dropdown in the center-top of MO2. No further steps are required.

##  Building Bodies and Armors with BodySlide

All the armors in this list are huge in size. The custom fits are not included by default.

**You MUST run BodySlide on your own before you launch Skyrim or weird stuff will happen. This _can_ and _will_ include people wearing ugly brown underwear, people with body proportions that change when nude or wearing different outfits, and more.**

1. **MAKE CERTAIN YOU ARE ON LIGHT BUT KINKY.** Doing so with ensure that all armors for both profiles will be built in one go.
3. Launch _BodySlide_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, where you can find a dropdown with items such as _SKSE_, _Skyrim_ and the _Skyrim Launcher_. 
4. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
5. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
7. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
8. Select your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
9. Ensure that the _Preset_ is set to "3BBB HangEmHigh."
9. Check the _Group Filter_ dropdown to ensure that it reads _3BBB_. (It's just to the left of the _Outfit Filter_ in the upper-right corner.) 
10. If that dropdown is blank, or something else is listed there, click the small **magnifying glass** within the _Groups Filter_ dropdown.
11. Place a check in the box beside _3BBB_ (the top option).
12. Click **OK**.
14. Ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
15. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
16. You will see a huge list of bodies and armors. Just click _Build_.
17. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted armors. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
18. **Do not put your armors anywhere but _BodySlide Output_. Do not put them inside a _meshes_ folder inside of _BodySlide Output_. They should go only in _BodySlide Output_.**
18. I have combined the options greatly so nobody has to waste a lot of time in here. The only thing you need to choose is the color of hair poking out of a few helmets. If you are female, it is probably best to put your own hair color here. If you are male, it doesn't matter, but any female you encounter with one of these helmets will have the hair color you chose here.
19. Once you have all four helmets chosen, press **OK**.
20. Wait for all the outfits to be built.
35. If you have _no interest_ in the _Light But Kinky_ variant, you are now finished. Skip to the last step.
36. Click the magnifying glass next to _3BBB_.
37. Uncheck _3BBB_ at the top and check _Unassigned_ at the bottom.
14. Ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
15. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
16. Right-click anywhere in the small window and choose _Select None_.
17. Scroll through the list until you find "BreastRopeExtreme01." Only the most extreme of breast ropes for us!
18. Select all entries until you reach "BreastRopeWithWaistRopeExtreme02", select it, and then stop.
19. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the small window.
20. Starting at the bottom and moving up, check the entries from "ZAZGSBDoggieBelt" to "Shibari."
21. Press _Build_.
17. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted breast ropes. Make sure they go to **_LeS Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
18. **Do not put your ropes anywhere but _BodySlide Output_. Do not put them inside a _meshes_ folder inside of _BodySlide Output_. They should go only in _BodySlide Output_.**
18. The ropes should build so fast you'll hardly notice.
49. If at any point you received a message that an outfit failed to build, write down the outfit that failed, select it from the dropdown, and click the big _Build_ button in the bottom-center. Repeat for any other failed outfits until you get no errors.
50. You should now be ready to launch Skyrim with the _SKSE_ option under the _Executables_ dropdown. Make certain to switch back to _Light But Sexy_ if that is the list you wish to play.

##  A Note on SexLab for the Uninitiated

Skyrim was never designed to have animations injected into it. It most certainly was never intended to pair two actors in a close space and perfectly align them for a sex scene. Animators do a lot of the work, but the engine is far from ideal. On top of that, there are many poorly aligned animations out there. In any case, no matter how good your animations, you will often find problems like: people kissing the air, _parts_ not going _into_ each other, characters floating above the ground, or even more wacked-out stuff like falling into the ground, clipping into furniture, or people going invisible. Fortunately, SexLab allows you to correct _some_ of this with manual positioning for each animation. Here's how it works... the _L_ key on your keyboard moves you _forward,_ i.e. closer to your partner. _Shift-L_ moves you _backward,_ or the reverse. _;_ moves you _up_, or higher in elevation than your partner. _Shift-;_ does the reverse. Finally, _'_ moves you _Right_ compared to your partner, whereas _Shift-'_ moves you _Left_. (Or maybe the other left.) Get used to these, you'll be using them a lot.

##  Admiring Yourself

For those who want a little POV action or to play primarily in first person, _IFPV_ (Immersive First-Person View) is included. It's a little wonky, so it's disabled by default. Ensure you're in first person mode (F key by default) and press _NUMPAD 0_ to enable it. Then press the F key again and look downward. Tah-Dah! Should work tolerably well for POV scenes (maybe a bit of clipping) except for animations where the actors are _really_ close to each other. To switch to _vanilla_ first person for gameplay, hit the F key at any time. _If you are on Light but Kinky, please note issues with IFPV in the Troubleshooting section._

**You cannot switch to third person anymore without deactivating IFPV with _NUMPAD 0_!**

You can always watch a scene from an external view with SexLab's default freecam available with _NUMPAD 3_. Use the mouse to look around and WASD to move your "camera".

##  Specific to Light But Sexy

###  Defeat

Defeat is ... a little buggy, to say the least... but I have included it in _Light But Sexy_ as a potential death alternative. I have most of it disabled because it breaks too often and forces a reload. About the only things left active in my setup are the ability to "surrender" with the _K_ key, or assault people with the _G_ key. Surrender as soon as you're outnumbered if you want a scene because the delay can be excessive. You can attempt assaults with _G_ if you are **completely undetected** but it will often fail with a two minute timeout before you can try again. This being _Defeat_, it does not inform you of failures or successes. A better option is to back up until your crosshair disappears from your target and press _G_ to "target". You should receive a message that says "_Target_ Marked." Knock them down with an unarmed attack. (If they are really weak they might die from a critical strike.) As much as I would have liked to leave _Witness Intervention_ enabled it is just a total cluster when things start going wrong. Honestly you probably shouldn't even bother, even though _Defeat_ does let you do a lot of devious things after you knock somebody down. It's easier to just set up a scene with _Tools_ (NumPad 2) and use your imagination. If you want to enable more of this mod's features it feel free, but be prepared for situations such as being stuck to the ground, unable to move, stuck to the ground _and_ unable to move, or unable to interact with anything or open your inventory. I will not help you resolve Defeat's issues.

##  Specific to Light But Kinky

###  Cursed Loot

The thing you have to remember about _Cursed Loot_ is that, once its in your modlist, your game is no longer about Skyrim and it is now about Cursed Loot. It does everything from overhauling loot, to adding followers, to changing combat and buffs, to prostitution, to prison overhaul, to death alternatives. It even has an alternate start and other quests to help you get a feel for how the mod works. Once you activate _Light But Kinky_, I have provided two gameplay options for this mod. Both are enabled to ensure they are downloaded but one is hidden. The first (and recommended) option is _Cursed Loot Lenient_ which you will see under **Outputs** in the left pane. Leave everything untouched for infrequent, mild encounters with bondage gear that's relatively easy to escape from until you hit level 20 where things start getting a bit more hardcore. If you are a glutton for punishment, double-click on _Cursed Loot Punishing._, go to the _FileTree_ tab at the top, and find the _JSON_ file that has _mohidden_ at the end and choose _Unhide_. If it starts to frustrate you and you wish to go back to lenient, repeat the process except choose _Hide._ It's probably best to treat this as a nightmarish survival mode that you should only play to avoid your invitable enslavement or imprisonment for as long as possible before starting over. The key "mechanic" of this mod (such as it is) is that you keep your arousal down via sexual acts to prevent "cursed traps" from triggering that lock you into bondage gear, make you more aroused, spiraling down into a self-defeating loop. One tip that people often miss: lucky charms against curses, bondage keys and sex-related potions are almost always hidden in flowers, plants, and bushes for some weird reason. (I guess that's where all the creeps hide to watch the women in Iron Pasties.) For more details I suggest you do a little searching on LoversLab.com for the Cursed Loot landing page and read up on it. It shouldn't be difficult to find, it's about the most popular mod there.

## Best Save Practices: READ ME!

Heavily modded Skyrim setups can result in save corruption in the best of circumstances. It is not likely but it is possible, and considering this might result in a save that can never be loaded again, highly undesirable. This likelihood is increased now that Wabbajack is introducing _Lover's Lab_ mods into the mix, which are notorious for resource-heavy cloak scripting, inappropriately terminated scripts that persist on the save file, and other issues. That is why I must **insist** that you follow _Wabbajack Official Save Diligence_ while playing this modlist. _If you die_ while playing, _do not allow the game to load you into the same cell (dungeon, cave, region) that you died in._ There are three ways to prevent this. 

1. All autosaving is disabled by default. Save every time you are about to pass through a door requiring a load screen where you might die. If you meet your end, load the save before you entered. Only complete zones from "bonfire to bonfire" (load screen to load screen) like this, and this way you will avoid the possibility of save corruption.
2. Save as much as you like, but after every death, completely exit Skyrim to the desktop and launch the game again to continue. This is the most recommended but also most annoying option considering how long a Skyrim with 400 mods takes to boot up.
3. If in large exterior areas like Tamriel, only save every five to ten minutes or before entering an interior zone to ensure you cross a full cell before saving. Only load saves made at these intervals.
4. **The most important thing to remember is that you can NOT "save scum" (load and save, load and save, seconds apart to get the best result) like you can in an unmodded game.** You will almost guarantee crashing and/or save corruption if you do this.

I experimented with alternate autosave systems to prevent all these headaches, but found several instances where they saved the game right at the beginning or during unavoidable SexLab scenes, such that when reloaded, an immediate crash was the only result. This is just as bad as a corrupt save, in my opinion, so I have ceased the experimentation. **Don't Get Me Wrong** SSSO would be a beautiful mod in this list were it not for _SexLab_'s quirks. If save corruption develops into a more serious issue I may explore respawn possibilities for LeS.

##  Adding Followers, Outfits, and Other Mods

This is not "officially" supported as per _Wabbajack Rule 11_. That said, I know you want to do it anyway, so I will offer this instruction.

**Screen Archery** by adding _Poser Mods_ is not supported. Download the _Cupid_ modlist for this purpose.

For _Gear_ it's as simple as adding it under _Added Mods_ and above _INTENTIONALLY DISABLED_ in the left pane and the very bottom in the right pane. If your gear mod does something crazy like add a huge museum of displays or put in chests for you to find you might have some issues. Otherwise, just use _AddItemMenuPackSE_ (in your inventory by default) to search for the item by name and put it in your inventory. _AddItem_ is the ultimate cheat, by the way, so don't use it if you want to play the "game" part of the game. I leave it in because this list is mostly sexy people and I want players to look good exactly the way they want.

For _Follower Mods_ add them and enable them under _Added Mods_ and above _INTENTIONALLY DISABLED_ in the left pane and just above _DynDOLOD_ in the right pane. If they have a lot of custom scripting (Lucien and Inigo are especially guilty of this), you will have to craft an _NFF Ignore Token_ and equip it on them after you recruit them. Be sure _not_ to "Import" incompatible followers into the _Framework_ or everything will break. If you are unsure about your follower, read its description page and all compatibility notes for any problems with "Nether Follower Framework." If any are mentioned, you will probably need an Ignore Token. If your follower mod contains any _world or cell edits_ (changes to game spaces handled in my modlist), there may be more severe conflicts. This usually only happens if the Follower has quests to go along with them. No way to know for sure unless you "filter for conflicts" with _SSEEdit._

Finally, there is a reason I didn't pile this list with the "Greatest Hits of _Lover's Lab_". Most _Lover's Lab_ mods feature extensive scripting which conflicts with other mods, adds a large burden to Papyrus (Skyrim's rather inefficient scripting engine), or both. Mods that constantly scan for changes in the player, other people, or creatures are especially bad for _cloak scripts_ that never terminate. This includes mods that let your hair grow, your boobs get full of milk, or god forbid give every woman in Tamriel a menstrual cycle. I do not and can not support the addition of these mods. If you want them, play with them until they break and start the game over from a pre-configured save in the cell. I can almost guarantee that they will break unless you are extremely conservative. To solve all these issues would require knowledge of Papyrus coding which I do not possess, and likely a migration of a lot of the code to a more efficient scripting language. 

It might be possible to squeeze in a greater amount of such mods on a more barebones version of Skyrim. If so, I invite you to download a simple "base" list from **#unofficial-modlist-submissions** to ensure you have critical fixes and then build your list up from scratch. You can always drop by **#NSFW-mod-discussion** to compare experiences.

Before asking about adding a mod, read the list below. I **will not** help you add any of these to _Licentia et Servitium_ or any other list. And I hate to say it but I can almost guarantee significant difficulties if you try to use more than one of them at a time. I am not saying they are "bad" mods, just that they are difficult to implement or maybe just incompatible with my setup. 

	- Dripping When Aroused
	- Egg Factory
	- Estrus Chaurus
	- EstrusForSkyrimSE
	- Fall of the Dragonborn SSE
	- Fertility Mode
	- Fill Her Up SE
	- Horny Creatures of Skyrim
	- Horrible Harrassment
	- Horrible Harrassment for Him SE
	- Immersive Hair Growth and Styling
	- Milk Addict SE
	- Milk Mod Economy SE (Full or Light)
	- Mini SSE Needs
	- Sanguine's Debauchery Enhanced
	- Scent of Sex SE
	- Sexlab Approach Redux (For Her or For Him)
	- Sexlab Hentai Pregnancy Special Edition
	- Sexlab Survival Special Edition
	- Skooma Whore SE
	- SL Separate Orgasm SE
	- SlaveTats
	- Spank That Ass SE
	- The Milk Maid SE
	- The Sisterhood of Dibella

**The above list is incomplete.** I will also not support or convert any mods listed as _unstable, beta, or uncoverted_ on _Lover's Lab_. This includes a few big ones like Sanguine's Debauchery and Slaverun Reloaded. For a full list of converted and unconverted mods, check the _Conversion Tracking_ pin in **#NSFW-mod-discussion**.

All that said, if you can't figure out a mod on your own that I did not mention above, I may help you work it in on a case-by-case basis depending on how busy I am. It is expected that you have familiarity with Mod Organizer 2, xEdit, FNIS, Nemesis, and a touch of conflict resolution before you try to do anything beyond basic outfit additions.

# A bit of a note on System Settings: IMPORTANT!

I have had users experience incidents where my Skyrim default settings were not being installed upon the completion of _Wabbajack._ Before continuing, ensure that under the _System Menu_ (ESC) the following options are chosen.

## Settings 

### Gameplay

Everything here should be **UNCHECKED** except for _Show Floating Markers_. Difficulty is recommended at _Expert_, but is ultimately up to you.

### Display

_Depth of Field_ should be all the way to the left.

## Controls

These are all to your liking, except for _Quicksave_ which should be set to _F9_, and _Quickload_ which should be set to _F10_. Don't worry about using them becuase _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves.

# Game MCM Options

**NOTE**: Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have ceased appearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing. Even after they have stopped, give it another five or ten seconds, just in case.

##  SexLab

Under **Install**

Click **INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8**

Close the menu and wait for a message in the upper left corner informing you that SexLab is ready. Then open the MCM and continue.

###  Sex Diary

**Sexuality: Your choice.**

Only determines which sex causes your arousal level to increase if you see them naked.

###  Rebuild & Clean

Click **Import Settings: Click Here**

It should confirm this choice, wait for the message after you click it.

If you are playing _Light But Kinky_ **and** wish to experience potentially involuntary encounters with non-humanoid entities, enable _Creature Animations_ on the _Animation Settings_ page, close the menus, and wait until the _Enabled_ message appears **twice**.

**A bit of a note on strap-ons**

It seems that strap-ons are universally loathed among the Skyrim NSFW community, but SexLab loves them in female scenes and likes to use them at every opportunity if they are enabled. So I have included an old and forgotten Oldrim mod called "equippable schlong" available in the **Rebuild/Clean Menu**. It basically attaches a full SOS schlong to female characters with physics and collisions instead of a strap-on and is fully customizable from Racemenu. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Go back to **Rebuild/Clean**.
2. Disable the terrible SexLab strapon by clicking **Calyps Strapon - Remove**.
3. Close the MCM and open your inventory.
4. Click on the item _AddItemMenu_.
5. Pull out the item _AddItemMenu - Search_ (the one with the box icon, not the book icon).
6. Close and re-open your inventory.
7. Click on _AddItemMenu - Search_.
8. Type in _Schlong_ and click on _Equipable Schlong_ (yes it is misspelled).
9. If you are running _Light But Kinky_ be sure to configure _Cursed Loot_ as per the instructions first or you will cover the schlong in shame when you go naked.
10. Equip the schlong from your inventory.
10. Open the console with the _tilde_ key (`).
11. Type in _TFC_.
12. Close the console with the same key.
13. Adjust the camera with WASD + mouse to get a good view of the pelvic region, preferably from the side.
14. Open the console again.
15. Type in _showracemenu_.
16. Navigate over to _Genitals_.
17. Adjust that bad boy as you see fit.
18. Open your inventory and drop it on the ground.
19. Open the console again and type tfc a final time.

It should automatically appear when appropriate (Amorous Adventures scenes are the worst for this).

##  A Matter of Time

###  Presets

Click **User Settings: Load User Settings**

Answer yes and wait for confirmation.

##  AGO

###  Settings

The only one you need to de-select is **Persistent Arrows.**

## Cathedral Weather

### Settings

Uncheck **Configuration Spell**.

## CBBE 3BBB Addon

**Only necessary for _Light But Kinky_**

Click on every **Use Slot** and change it to _60 - Devious Devices Compatible_.

##  CGO

###  Settings

Set **Hotkey** to _Shift._ This enables you to use any weapon one or two handed. Keep in mind that the way you wield a weapon affects how you skill up, e.g. two-handed grip levels up two-handed, etc. Dual-wielding bacon is not yet an option.

Set **Dual Wield Blocking** to _Mouse 3_. This is your scroll-wheel button, if you have one. Otherwise, you are going to have to make a judgment call.

**Enable iFrames** for a little Souls-ish gameplay.

Ensure that **NPCs Dodge** is _unchecked_.

I like the _procedural 1.00 leaning_, but if it seems a bit silly to you, toning it back to _0.50_ might be more appropriate. Turn it off completely if you hate the idea of it.

Finally scroll down and under **Unlocked Movement** ensure that **Power Attacks (NPCs)** is _unchecked_.

##  Cursed Loot

**Only available with _Light But Kinky_.**

This mod will act wildly different depending on whether you enabled the _Lenient_ or _Punishing_ preset in MO2. In either case, go to

###  Debug

And hit **Import Settings** and confirm.

##  Deadly Dragons

These boys are plenty hard on Vanilla, so just remove **Knockdown** from their abilities.

##  Devious Device Helpers

**Only available with _Light But Kinky_.**

This is a lot to take in so just disable the random bondage option for Shops and Other Dwellings. Just keep in mind if your follower asks to tie you up to give it some serious thought!

##  Devious Devices

**Only available with _Light But Kinky_.**

Tailor this to your _Cursed Loot_ preset. If you are running "Punishing" just leave everything as it is. If you are running "Lenient" I recommend tuning all the difficulties to **Vanilla**, **Disable Lock Jam**, set **Blindfold Strength** to 0.10 and **Dark Fog Strength** to 200, disable **Boots Slowdown Effect**, **Hardcore Bondage Mittens** and set **Hobble Skirt Debuff Strength** to 25, which is the lowest (fastest movement) it will go.

##  Extended UI

Check **Hide Legendary UI elements**, **Show attribute modifiers**, and **Show skill modifiers**.

##  FEC

###  Player Effects

You could spend all day in here so I just recommend enabling **Soul Absorb**.

##  Follower Framework

###  System

Hit **Load From File** and exit the menu. Then re-enter.

You might want to check out the hotkeys to see what they've been set to. They're inspired by our overlord.

##  GIST Soul Trap

Just enable **Show message on soul trapped**

## LOTD Settings

This is primarily intended for moments in _Light But Kinky_ when you can't Fast Travel.

### Shipment Crate Locations

Enable the following: _Carriages_, _Inns_, _Player Homes_.

## Moonlight Tales

Disable **Transform Back Stagger**

Set **Difficulty Scale** to _Expert_ (This makes your werewolf form more powerful, not less)

Set **Werewolf Appearance** to _Alpha (Black with Red Eyes)

_When you spawn in game_

The "Ancient Ring" will ask you for your Difficulty again. Answer _Expert._

Use this MCM to remove the "Ancient Ring" from your inventory under **Tools**.

##  Quick Light

Set **Type of Light Source** to _Lantern_

**Brightness** to _Wide

**Light Key** to _NUMPAD 1_

##  Sacrosanct Vampires

Only thing you need to tick here is **Fortitude: Disable**

##  SexLab Aroused

Hit **Purge Dead Actors Every 10 Game Days** and **Enable SOS**.

##  SexLab Eager NPCs

**Only available with _Light But Sexy_.**

###  General

Hit **Enable and load profile**. You'll be having a _lot_ of sex on the installed profile. If that bothers you, come back to this menu and tinker with the options until you get something you like.

This mod takes a bit to activate. Exit the MCM and wait for two abilities to be added, then open it and continue.

##  SexLab LightMeUp

### Settings

Change &&Minimum lighting for auto lights** to _75._

##  SexLab Solutions

**Only available with _Light But Sexy_.**

###  Followers

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

###  Miscellaneous

**Integration**: click _SLEN integration_

## SINFul CBP

I recommend you **Load into** Slot 01, which uses the _Popstar_ preset with very low belly bounce exception.

But feel free to try out a different preset by selecting one and jiggling your jigglies.

**Note**: Any time you turn on _SMP_ these settings are overridden by that engine.

##  Sky UI

###  General

**Font Size** to _Small_

Disable **Active Effects HUD**

###  Controls

Set the first four **Favorite Groups** to _F5 - F8_ to avoid a conflict with follower commands. 

**PLEASE NOTE**: QuickSave is set to _F9_ and QuickLoad to _F10_ in both of my variants. Do not change them back.

##  SL Anim Loader

###  General Options

Press **Enable All: Click Here**

Press **Register Animations: Click Here**

Wait for the "Registered X new animations" message. Be patient, it can take up to five minutes.

##  SLA Monitor Widget

###  Scanner Settings

Customize the scanner to your taste. It will tell you who (or what) is horny and how greatly. If you are only interested in females, choose that option. If you are only interested in humanoids, choose that option. It's up to you.

I must insist that you set **Interval** of no lower than _60_ and a **Range** of no greater than _1024_.

###  Widget Looks

Recommend **Vertical Anchor** of _Center_ and **Font size** of _16 PTS._

This takes a bit too. Exit the MCM and re-enter.

##  Storm Lightning

###  Presets

Choose **Ultra Realistic** and wait for it to say _DONE_

### Advanced

Be certain to tick **Compatibility Mode**.

##  Trade & Barter

###  Barter Rates

Enable **Modify Barter Settings**

Select **Barter Presets: Medium**

##  Ultimate Combat

###  General

Disable **Speed Bonus.**

###  NPC Setting

**NPC**

Select **Dodge: Disable**.

##  Wildcat Combat

Be sure to press

**Disable Dynamic Combat**

Because it causes a lot of weirdness.

Under **Difficulty** hit _Allow Wildcat to Manage Difficulty_.

##  Defeat

Only available with _Light But Sexy_.

###  General Settings

First hit **Install Mod.** Close the MCM and wait for the message _Defeat: Installed_. 

Re-open.

Next, hit **Import Settings** on the right.

## XPMSE

**Only relevant to _Light But Kinky_.**

I don't know why but this mod gets all wonky on _LBK_. Change all of the _Styles_ options to _Default_ or you'll have weird issues like disappearing sheathed weapons or drawn arrows sticking to your hand.

##  ZaZ Animation Pack

Only available with _Light But Kinky_.

###  General

Don't change anything if you're on "Punishing." Otherwise, set **Bound Hands** to _Light Struggle,_ **Shackled Movement Speed** to 100%, and **Blindfold Amount** and **Pulse** to 10%.

###  SexLab

This menu takes a good minute to appear after you click on it. It may seem stuck. Just wait. Afterward, hit **SexLab Animations: Register** and wait a good bit until the greyed out word _Registered_ appears. Then uncheck the **Override** as Devious already handles this function.

# All done!

There you go, fellow deviant. Be sure to press **F9** for a last second save in case spawning into Skyrim prompts a crash (which has been known to happen). Talk to the Mara statue to begin your journey. If you are on _Light But Sexy_, I recommend one of the _Something Sexy_ starts (dropped nude into a sticky situation) and if you are on _Light But Kinky_, I recommend the _Sex Slave_ start for a good look into how _Cursed Loot_ works. Spoiler though, there is no sex, just lots of bouncy-boobed slow-walking in bondage gear. 

However you choose to enjoy NSFW Skyrim, soft or hard, I hope your experience is fulfilling (or at least titillating.) Keep checking the NSFW channels for releases including _Cupid_, _Lotus_ and _Bakarim_ which are far more in-depth than I can muster.

#  Troubleshooting

## I can't even launch _Mod Organizer_ because it tells me I don't have permission for a downloads directory.

This is my mistake because I have such little free hard drive space as a modlist developer. Sometimes I switch directories around and forget to revert them. If this happens to you, open _ModOrganizer.ini_ and type in your downloads directory instead of the one I have listed.

##  What are all these Form 43 warnings? I thought Form 43 was bad news. 

In the normal modding world this would be true, but this is Lover's Lab, which is notoriously resistant to change. Some of the mods have issues if they are converted. So **do not attempt to convert the Form 43 plugins into form 44**! These are left this way intentionally. I can't stop MO2 from warning you about them but I can strongly insist that you not act on those warnings.

## Why are there so many duplicated animation folders? _or_ Why do I have to CTRL-CLICK to build _BodySlide_?

_Mod Organizer 2_ does not put edits to existing files in the _overwrite_ folder, only newly created files. _CBBE_, _3BBB_ and _BD_ come with "default" meshes that will be changed by _BodySlide_ if you do not direct them to the proper directory yourself. Likewise, _Nemesis_ edits all the animation source files when it updates instead of putting the changes in the overwrite folder. If you don't believe me, I encourage you to check _MO2_'s documentation or the _Nemesis_ closed _Issues_ section on Github. If this doesn't convince you, I encourage you to test it yourself.

## I tried to wear a piece of gear but my body disappeared!

The _Devious_ equipment is invisible unless _BodySlide_ is fully run. Follow all the steps in the _BodySlide_ section again.

##  My skin pokes through my armor! or My bald head pokes through my hood!

Particularly voluptuous (thicc) BodySlide presets will cause clipping (skin poking through clothing) on some outfit variants that are skintight. This may include randomized women from BodyGen. Nothing can be done about this so either ignore it or generate everyone with a more subdued BodySlide preset. 

There are also issues with some hoods causing bald heads to poke through that I have yet to resolve. This mostly happens when the PC wears a hooded robe and crouches, so if it bothers you, don't do either of those things.

## Some of me is too _jiggly_! (Especially the belly.)

I tried to minimize it as much as possible, but the available CBPC presets are kinda not ideal. Either reinstall the _CBBE 3BBB_ mod (position 256) and experiment with the CBPC options or install _Sinful CBPC_ (Google it) for fine control. Load order shouldn't matter, but if the MCM won't appear, open the console and type _setstage ski_configmanagerinstance 1_ and wait for the message(s).

## I read a skill book but my skill didn't go up!

This is because you "can't concentrate" if you're horny, so you don't get 100% skill experience from skill books. Check the _Magic Effects_ tab of your _Magic_ window for **red** effects that affect experience gain. Usually they are marked **Lover's Desire**. If you're not locked up with something alleviate that need and then read the book. If you're locked into gear and can't _take care of business_, you're out of luck. Leave the book where it is and read the next one you come across, otherwise it will be wasted.

## I'm running _Light But Kinky_ and I can't find my save!

Try using _Show All Saves._ Devious or Cursed Loot (one of the two) sometimes puts them in a weird place, most likely because of legacy scripts.

## CGO isn't leaning / dodging! _or_ When I go into an adult scene, I hear sounds and voices but they just stand there!

I sometimes forget to run _Nemesis_ before uploading a build. Smack me on Github or in the channel and I'll do it. If you don't want to wait follow these instructions.

1. Choose whichever variant you wish to play, _Light But Sexy_ or _Light But Kinky_
2. **Ensure that all FNIS mods are disabled in the left pane. Yes, this includes FNIS Output.**
3. Select  _Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine_ from the _Executables_ drop down box (same place as _SKSE_ and _BodySlide_)
4. Press **RUN**
5. **Only for _Light But Sexy_**: Ensure that _Archery Gameplay Overhaul_, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE_, _360 Movement Behavior SE_, _Gender Specific Animations_, and _Ultimate Combat / TK Dodge_ are all **CHECKED**
6. **Only for _Light But Kinky_**: Ensure that _Archery Gameplay Overhaul_, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE_, _Gender Specific Animations_, and _Ultimate Combat / TK Dodge_ are all **CHECKED**
7. Press **Update Engine**. Be patient, it can sometimes take upwards of three minutes.
8. Once you receive the message "Engine Update Complete," press **Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine.** This will also require patience.
9. When you receive the "Complete" message, close the Engine with the _X_ box.
10. **Only for _Light But Kinky_**: Re-enable _FNIS Output_ in the left pane.
11. You are ready to play _Skyrim_ by choosing _SKSE_ from the _Executables_ drop down box and pressing **RUN**

##  I did all that but the things are still just standing there, especially when I assault someone / get assaulted.

_Skyrim Special Edition_ is not well supported by the _Lover's Lab_ community, or at least not as robustly. Most players seeking to use such content do so on _Oldrim_ or _Legendary Edition,_ which unfortunately suffers from an inferior engine as far as stability and memory management goes. _Legendary Edition_ is also not "officially" available on _Steam_ any longer, which discourages primary mod (and modlist) developers from supporting it. 

As such, animations triggered from the SE versions of _Defeat_ and _Cursed Loot_ seem to be called in a slightly different fashion than those from _SL Tools_, _SL Solutions_, or _SLEN_. They suffer from intolerable script lag at times, regardless of how many mods or animations are installed. I understand it's a known issue that is being worked on, but until it is resolved, you'll have to break your immersion a bit. If an animation seems stuck **and** there are no moans of pleasure, just various breathing and grunts (or silence), open the console with the tilde key (`), wait for all messages to cycle, then close the console again. You may have to repeat this process at least once.

## My arms won't go into a binder _or_ my hands are floating outside of my bindings _or_ my gag won't go in my mouth _or_ one of these is true for an NPC.

First, if you added something, remove it or rerun _Wabbajack._ If you didn't add anything, there's not much I can do. _Devious_ handling of these matters is extremely finicky in its original version on Oldrim and even more so for Special Edition. Facial Expressions in Special Edition have always been a problem and the NPC arm / invisible hands problem persists to this day no matter which version you use. If you want a more bug-free game, don't use _Devious Devices_ because this is **way** out of Skyrim's purview.

##  I'm locked into some gear and I can't move in third person.

_Devious Devices_ doesn't like the SE version of _Immersive First Persion View_ very much. Don't disable IFPV after enabling it or you will get this bug every time you stop moving while in restrictive gear. If you were unaware of this fact, save your game, reload, and the problem should go away. Don't enable _Immersive First Person View_ while locked up unless you plan to stay in first person.

# Gameplay Tips - Walkthroughs - Light Spoilers for the Hopelessly Stuck.

## I was locked up in the "princess" start and something defeated me and I got teleported somewhere and the quest was completely broken! This isn't fair!

Life isn't fair and _Cursed Loot_ doubles down on that. Seriously, though, there are a couple of weird spawn areas that can be troublesome with _Animallica_ and _Immersive Patrols_. Be sure to save your game before exiting the hideout either time and hope you don't get a mob spawn nearby or at Sarethi farm.

## I can't find those damn keys in the _Light But Kinky_ "princess" start!

They are non-existent until triggered. The _hideout key_ spawns outside on a random slaver corpse after you are free from the cage. You must search every body until you find it. I will tell you that the bodies are all near the road and do not go beyond the man on the ledge on one extreme or the man in the weeds on the other, so keep checking. The _office key_ spawns when you search the body of the Slaver Boss and read the note pop-up. Search every corpse and chest in the room until you find it. If you can't find it at first, keep searching until you do. I have never had an instance where it didn't show (and I have tested it many, many, _many_ times)

## Where the hell do I go after Chloe tells me about the secret passage?

Go back out the way you came and to the cave where Ralof and Hadvar are. The main quest may break if you go through _Cursed Loot's_ "narrow passage" shortcut and the _Unofficial Patch_ makes sure to warn you about it, so I have removed that option. Go all the way back in the cave until you get to the room with the spiders, kill them (or let Chloe do it, she's a beast) and search the Imperials in there for a _Torn Note_. Read the note.
