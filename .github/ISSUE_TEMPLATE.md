This template was stolen with minor adustments from erri120. Just type over the non-bolded sections with your own words.

**Describe the bug**
Describe the bug as well as you can. Use precise language.

**What you were doing when the bug happened**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. I was 'here'
2. With 'these people or creatures' (none is an option)
3. And did 'this'

**Is the bug repeatable**
If you go to the same place and do the same thing with the same stuff, does it happen again? If not, I may not be able to solve it. Yes or no will be enough.

**Expected behavior**
Tell me what would have happened after step 3 above if everything were perfect for you.

**Screenshots**
If you can make the bug happen again, take a screenshot of the thing that causes it right before it happens. I highly recommend opening the console with the tilde key and clicking on the thing that has a bug. Take the screenshot with all the gobbledygook showing. Use F12 and find the latest bmp in your Skyrim folder. (Note: the Steam game folder, not the LeS directory.)

**Modlist version**
3.0

**Did you add any additional mods?**
Yes or no and which mod you added. I don't mind terribly but I need to know what they are. If you added more than two or three you are on your own.

**WARNING**
If you waste my time pretending you didn't add stuff when you did or otherwise "neglecting" to mention things you know are causing problems, I will cease all support.
