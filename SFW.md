## SFW Mods

I'm just going to touch on these since most of them are in other lists (particularly Lexy's), so many people will already be familiar with them.

### Dragons

The familiar combo of _Deadly Dragons + Diverse Dragons + Dragon Variants_ is in here, with all that entails. It's rather difficult if you're used to the boring dragons from vanilla Skyrim because now they shoot fireballs and rain them from the sky among loads of other things, so if you're new to this setup get ready.

### Animals

I have included [Animallica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20456) for greater variety in taxidermy targets because the same old wolves get boring fast and Immersive Creatures has crashing issues on a lot of setups. There's a bit of an incompatibility with MNC if you're on Kinky but I think the added variety is worth it as I rarely play with that mod. 

### Followers

I use [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076) to allow for up to 100 followers or summoned NPC's (but realistically you'll have to keep it to six or fewer). Most of the options are self-explanatory but if you want then to join you at your level and gain them when you do, you can open the console, click on them, and enter the command "bat nfflevel"

### Transformations

My chosen vampire mod is Enai's [Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928) because it's the most compatible, but for werewolves I use the old standby [Moonlight Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35470). Both are a bit overpowered in this setup but you can tweak the MCMs if you find things getting too easy.
