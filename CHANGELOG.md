## Changelog

### 1.1.4.1

- Forgot to enable Display Tweaks for Light But Kinky. Rather important so I'm uploading this hotfix.
- Added a neat little plugin to make sure "notes" are distinguishable from "books" in your inventory.

### 1.1.4

- Updated Legacy of the Dragonborn Patches (Official) to v2.0. The only way this will affect you is if you are collecting items from the mod Artifacts of Skyrim. One artifact is missable if not collected from a corpse before it disappears. Only update if you experience this issue.
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to the latest version because mine was taken down. This is not a critical update either.

### 1.1.3

- Removed SSSO due to possibly incompatible save triggers near the beginning of SL scenes.
- Implemented a grass FPS fix although it may lead to less variability in grass cover density.
- Fixed an issue where footsteps could be heard while jumping.

### 1.1.2

Corrected all those damn Males of Skyrim again and spawned them all to make sure they looked good and talked to them all to make sure they didn't crash. The 2 Ulfrics shouting FusRoDah at the 2 Tulliuses made this difficult. Hopefully an ongoing Nemesis problem has been resolved as well.

### 1.1.1

Fixed a few BFBs from Males of Skyrim.

### 1.1

Corrections based on feedback from WJ's modlist testers.

### 1.0

Preparation for initial submission.

### 0.1.1

A lot of changes this time around due to problems that arose during my own testing. Please start reporting these on the issues tab, people! The main one was the installation of the standalone Creature Framework 1.1.02B to prevent certain... invisible equipment. Recommend you backup your saves before updating if you use LBK. Disabled Atlas Map Marker's overworld map to prevent fast travel that skips quest triggers. Activated several mods that should be deactivated by default, but must be active to ensure their installation by Wabbajack. Adjusted the footsteps to prevent doubling of certain sound effects. Converted a couple of plugins to Form 44 that I suspect caused crashes. Clarified options within the MCM to increase stability, compatibility, and user choice.

### 0.1.0.2

Hid the invalid script plugin leftover in MNC. This should cause no problems because the modder himself admitted he meant to remove it but forgot. Enabled the BodyGen3 folder from WJ NSFW so that it would properly download for the enduser. Changed breast physics to a more static variant to reflect possible usage of BodyGen. Disabled fast-travel to non-vanilla locations to prevent scripted event bugs. Finalized my ASLAL DCUR patch (hopefully) so there won't be any more damnable flickering in the slaver cave. Clarified instructions for BodySlide and FNIS/Nemesis in the README.

### 0.1.0.1

Downloaded and collected the metas for FNIS to ensure they would install properly for the enduser.

### 0.1

First release. The core of _Light But Sexy_ is intact, with a bunch of worldspace removals to prevent save bloat. Also, the universe's most-hated mod, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul_ is in for no other reason than I like playing with it. It's not Smashed or Mastered to anything so if you would prefer not to use it just disable it. The option is also here to use FNIS with Nemesis for creature animations and CGO, Nemesis or FNIS without CGO, as well as switching MO2 profiles to _Light But Kinky_ for Cursed Loot to resolve incompatibilities which cannot be accomplished in any other way.
